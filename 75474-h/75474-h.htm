<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stories of the Three Little Trippertrots, though
never before published, have been told to thousands of children,
in a way, probably, that no tales have ever before
been related. They were read <i>over the telephone</i>, nightly, to
thousands of little folks, by means of the system operated
by the N. J. Telephone Herald Company. The stories so
delighted the children that the author has yielded to the
request to issue them in book form.</p>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS ARE LOST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, not so very many years ago, there
were two little boys, and a little girl, who lived with their
papa and mamma in a house in a big city. One of the
boys was named Tommy, and the other was called Johnny,
and the little girl’s name was Mary. Mary was seven years
old, Tommy was six, and Johnny was the youngest of all,
being only five years old. Now the children had a last name,
which was the funny one of Trippertrot. They were called
this because they were always tripping or trotting off somewhere
or other.</p>

<p>One day, when Tommy and Johnny and Mary were at
play in their house, the telephone bell rang, and Suzette,
the nursemaid, who had charge of the children, ran to answer
it.</p>

<p>“Who do you s’pose it is calling up?” asked Tommy of
Johnny.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; maybe it’s the milkman,” answered Johnny.</p>

<p>“Milkmen don’t have time to talk on a telephone,” said
Mary. “But I know what let’s do, Johnny and Tommy.
Now that Suzette isn’t here, let’s go out for a walk. She
won’t see us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! Let’s do it!” cried Johnny and Tommy
together, like twins, you know, only they weren’t, of course.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
They jumped up very quickly, and followed Mary out of
the house.</p>

<p>Now, of course, that wasn’t just the right thing to do—to
go away when Suzette wasn’t looking. But the Trippertrots
didn’t always do what was right, any more than do
some children whom I know—but, of course, I don’t mean
any of you. Anyhow, the Trippertrots ran away, and I’m
going to tell you what happened to them.</p>

<p>“Which way shall we go?” asked Tommy, when they
stood outside on the pavement.</p>

<p>“Let’s go off and see if we can find a fairy,” suggested
Mary.</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that,” cried Johnny, “for we might meet
a bad fairy, and she might turn us into an automobile with
a honk-honk horn, or an elephant with a long nose, or something
like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re going to take a walk, we’d better hurry,”
said Mary. “Suzette will soon be back from the telephone,
and she’ll miss us, and come looking for us, and then we’ll
have to go in and have our faces and hands washed. Hurry
up!”</p>

<p>“I know what’s the best thing to do,” exclaimed Tommy.
“We’ll go down the street, where the toy store is, and get
some things to play with.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t any money,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference,” Tommy replied. “I
mean we can look in the toy-store window and choose what
things we’d like to have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is fun!” agreed Johnny. “I heard a boy
do that one day, and he choosed a whole train of cars and
an engine.”</p>

<p>“But did he get them?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“No; but it was fun just the same. Come on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>So down the street the Trippertrot children went, hand
in hand, hurrying as fast as they could, and looking back
every now and then to see if Suzette was following them.
But she wasn’t.</p>

<p>And oh! what wonderful things those children saw as
they ran along! An automobile nearly banged into a trolley
car, and a dog just missed being run over by a peanut
wagon, and he barked almost as loudly as a lion can roar
when he’s hungry for popcorn balls in the circus.</p>

<p>Then the Trippertrots saw a man selling red and green
and yellow balloons, and pink paper pin-wheels. And pretty
soon they turned a corner, and there was a lady wheeling
two babies in the same carriage. What do you think of
that? They were twins, you know.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t they cute babies!” exclaimed Mary. “Let’s
stop and look at them, boys.”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t time,” said Johnny. “We’ve got to
hurry down to that toy store, and choose things, or we won’t
be back in time for tea, and we’d be hungry if we missed
that.”</p>

<p>So they hurried on faster and faster, still holding hands.
They went past one store, in the windows of which were
lots and lots of cakes, with pink and brown and white frosting
on, and Johnny wanted to stop there and choose one,
but Tommy hurried him on.</p>

<p>Then they went around a corner where a Chinaman was
ironing clothes right in the window of his shop, and past
another place where a man was digging a big hole in the
ground, and Mary nearly fell down in it, and she was very
much frightened, only her brothers pulled her away from it
just in time.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, a big automobile whizzed past,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
just as the Trippertrots were crossing the street, and a kind
man called to the children:</p>

<p>“Look out, little ones, or you’ll get run over!” Then
they ran as fast as they could run, and the man called after
them: “Aren’t you children lost?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, thank you,” answered Tommy. “We’re going
to the toy store to choose presents.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the man, and he went on his way,
laughing.</p>

<p>A little while after that Tommy stubbed his toe and fell
down. But do you suppose he cried? No, sir! not a bit
of it. Not a single tear, though he wanted to very much.</p>

<p>“But if I cry, and get my eyes full of water,” he thought,
“I might not be able to see in the toy-shop window to choose
things. So I’m not going to cry.”</p>

<p>Then Mary and Johnny rubbed the sore place on Tommy’s
leg, and Mary kissed him, and the Trippertrots went
on farther.</p>

<p>Then, just as the postman blew his whistle, they came
to the toy shop. Oh, I just wish you could have seen it!
The window was full of toy trains, and toy elephants who
could wiggle their heads and their trunks, and there were
dolls, and steam engines, and rocking-horses, and camels, and
lions, and tigers—not real, you know, only make-believe—so
don’t get frightened. And then there was an airship, with
a thing in front that went around whizzy-izzy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to choose that airship!” cried Johnny,
as soon as he saw it.</p>

<p>“No, it’s Mary’s turn first,” said Tommy. “Ladies are
always first, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course. I forgot,” admitted Johnny. “Go
on, Mary, you choose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“Well,” said Mary slowly, “I’ll take the doll with the
pink dress and the blue eyes.”</p>

<p>“Now I am going to take the airship!” cried Johnny
eagerly.</p>

<p>“And I want the big elephant that wiggles his nose,”
said Tommy. “Now it’s your turn again, Mary.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the little brass bed for my doll,” spoke the boys’
sister.</p>

<p>And so they went on. Well, those children just stood
there, choosing all the pretty toys in the store window, until
there were hardly any left. Only, you know, of course, that
it was only make-believe, for they didn’t really take the things
away.</p>

<p>Mary had just picked out a lovely doll carriage, and
Tommy was going to take a small automobile with wheels
that really went around, when, all of a sudden, the lady
who kept the toy store came out on the sidewalk, and said:</p>

<p>“I am afraid you children had better run home. You
have been standing here for some time, and your mamma
will worry about you, I’m sure. Run along, now, and take
this,” and she gave each of them a stick of nice candy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess we had better go home,” said Tommy.
“Which way do we go, Johnny?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know the way home, Tommy?” asked
his brother.</p>

<p>“No. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” answered Johnny, surprised like. “I
am all turned around. Maybe Mary knows.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the little Trippertrot girl, “you boys
don’t mean to tell me you don’t know where our house is,
do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“And I’m sure I don’t know,” answered Johnny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“We don’t either of us know,” went on Tommy in a sad
voice. “Do you know, Mary?” and he began to eat his
candy.</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. Then two tears came into her
blue eyes. Then came still more tears, until they rolled from
her cheeks, and splashed down on the sidewalk, like salty
rain.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she cried. “If none of us knows where our
home is we’re lost! We can’t ever find our house! What
shall we do?”</p>

<p>And there was no one there to tell the children what to
do, for the toy-store lady had gone back into her shop and
shut the door.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, along came a big, kind-looking
policeman, with a blue coat covered with brass buttons.
Tommy saw him first.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed Tommy. “Run! Run! Here
comes a policeman after us!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he may put us in jail!” said Johnny. “Run!”
So he and Tommy started to run, but Mary caught hold of
them.</p>

<p>“Stop, you silly boys!” she cried. “Don’t be afraid.
Mamma always said that if ever we got lost we should go to
a policeman right away. Now the policeman is coming to
us, and that is much better; so it’s all right.”</p>

<p>Then the nice big man with the brass buttons on his coat
came closer, and Mary said to him:</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Policeman, we’re the Trippertrot children,
and we’re lost. We don’t know where our house is. Will
you please find it for us?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” answered the policeman, with a jolly
smile. “Come along with me.”</p>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE KIND POLICEMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Are</span> you going to take us home right away, Mr. Policeman?”
asked Mary, as she and her brothers walked along
beside the big man.</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” he answered kindly. “But you must
first tell me where your home is, and then I can go there by
the shortest way. Where is your home?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” asked Johnny, and he stopped
there in the street and looked at a big automobile which was
whizzing along close behind a little fuzzy dog that was trying
to get out of the way of the big rubber wheels. “Don’t
you know where our house is, Mr. Policeman?” asked Johnny
again.</p>

<p>“Well,” spoke the big officer with the blue clothes, and
the brass buttons down the front, like a whole lot of shiny
eyes, “if you will tell me which street your house is on, I
think I can easily take you to it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t you even know the <i>street</i>?” asked Johnny,
and two tears came into his eyes, one in each, and splashed
down on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Why, can’t you tell me the street?” the policeman
wanted to know.</p>

<p>Mary shook her little head. Johnny shook his little head.
Tommy shook his little head. Then they all shook their
heads together, and they said, all at once:</p>

<p>“We—don’t—know!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“My! My!” exclaimed the policeman. “What am I
going to do with three lost children who don’t know where
they live?”</p>

<p>“I thought policemans knew everything,” said Mary
Trippertrot. “You ought to know about our house.”</p>

<p>“I only wish I did,” replied the officer. “But I’ll tell
you what I’ll do. I’ll give you a nice ride in a wagon, and
I’ll take you to a place where there are a whole lot of policemen,
and perhaps some of them may know where you live.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” cried Johnny. “Now we’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I know where he’s going to take us,” said
Tommy. “It’s to a fire-engine house, ’cause I once saw a
little lost boy in a fire-engine house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it isn’t,” said Mary. “He must be going to
take us to a police station. But I don’t care, for it’s nice
there. Once, Sallie Jones was lost, and she was taken to a
police station, and the men there gave her candy until her
mamma came for her. I know, ’cause she told me.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m glad we’re lost,” said Tommy, “’cause the
candy the toy-shop lady gave us is all gone.” And that’s as
true as I’m telling you, the Trippertrots had eaten up all
their candy.</p>

<p>“Come along, now, little ones,” said the kind policeman,
“and I’ll telephone for a wagon so that I can give you a
ride.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you’re going to telephone,” cried Mary, “you can
telephone to our house and tell mamma we’re coming home.
I know where our house is now! It’s where the telephone
is. We have one, and to-day, when Suzette went to answer
it, we ran out. That’s how we got lost. All you have to
do, Mr. Policeman, is to go to the house where our telephone
is, and we’ll be home.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Mary looked up at the big officer, but he only shook his
head.</p>

<p>“There are so many houses which have telephones in,”
he said, “that I could never find yours that way. But come
on.”</p>

<p>So he led them down the street until pretty soon he came
to a big fat telephone pole that looked like an elephant’s
leg in the circus. And on the pole was a blue box, which
opened just like the door of the cupboard where mother keeps
the bread and jam.</p>

<p>And inside the box were a whole lot of shiny things, and
a bell rang, like a telephone bell, and pretty soon the policeman
was talking into that box and telling some one away
far off at the police station to send a wagon for three little
lost children.</p>

<p>So there they stood, the three Trippertrots and the kind
policeman, waiting for the wagon to come. And a whole
lot of people gathered around and looked at the children,
and felt very sorry for them because they were lost. But
Mary and Johnny and Tommy weren’t a bit sorry. They
knew it would be all right, and that the policeman would
take care of them.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, a dog came running up the
street. He was a nice, fuzzy, yellow dog, and he had a tail
that he could wag. And what do you think he did? Why,
he crawled right in between the legs of a fat man who was
looking at the lost children, and then that dog went right
up close to Mary, and barked softly, just as if he was saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t you be worried now. I’m here, and I’ll take
care of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look! See the dog!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>“Is he your dog?” asked the policeman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“No,” answered Johnny, “but I guess we can have him
if we wish. Maybe he’s lost, too.”</p>

<p>“I believe he is!” cried Mary. “Look how tired he is!
I think we shall call him Fido, and he’ll be our dog; won’t
you, Fido?”</p>

<p>Well, I just wish you could have seen the dog wag his
tail at that! He nearly wagged it off, he was so happy because
Mary had called him Fido, for that was really his
name; and he was lost, but he didn’t care, now that he had
some children to love.</p>

<p>And then, while they were standing there, the three Trippertrots
and the dog and the kind policeman, along came the
wagon to take the children to the police station. And there
was a fine, big brown horse pulling the wagon.</p>

<p>“Now get in, little ones,” said the policeman kindly.</p>

<p>“You go first, Mary,” said Tommy politely. “Ladies are
always first.”</p>

<p>“No, let Fido get in first,” suggested Johnny. “He is
so tired, and he can lie down in the wagon. Here, Fido,
jump in!”</p>

<p>“But you can’t take that dog in the wagon,” said the
policeman, his face turning red.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Mary, and she patted Fido on the
head, so that he wagged his tail harder than ever.</p>

<p>“Because,” said the policeman, “we don’t like dogs in our
wagons; and besides, he isn’t your dog.”</p>

<p>“Of course he’s our dog!” cried Johnny. “He came to
us, and he’s ours. We’re going to keep him.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” added Tommy. “He’s lost, and we’re lost,
so he belongs to us.”</p>

<p>“And if we can’t have him we don’t want to ride in your
wagon, Mr. Policeman, though we like you very much,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Mary. “Fido must come with us. You want to come, don’t
you, Fido?” And she patted the dog’s head again.</p>

<p>Then what do you suppose that dog did? Why, he
wagged his tail up and down, instead of sideways, right up
and down he wagged it, like a pump handle.</p>

<p>“See!” cried Mary. “He’s saying ‘yes’ with his tail! He
wants to come, Mr. Policeman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my! Then I suppose he’ll have to go,” said the
officer, with a laugh, and everybody in the crowd laughed
also. “Get in, Fido; and you, too, children,” the policeman
went on.</p>

<p>So they all got in the wagon, the Trippertrots and the
dog and the policeman, and away they went. Tommy had
hold of Fido’s left ear, and Johnny had hold of his right
ear, and Mary had her hand on the dog’s head, and every
once in a while Fido would put his cold nose in the policeman’s
hand, to show that he liked him, and then the policeman
would jump as if a mosquito had bitten him, for he
wasn’t thinking about the dog. But Fido didn’t mind, and
he thumped his tail down on the floor of the wagon until it
sounded like a baby’s rattle-box.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they were almost at the police station, and
the policeman was wondering how he could find out where
the lost Trippertrots lived, when, all of a sudden, Fido saw
a pussy cat running along the sidewalk. And then, before
you could look at a picture in a story book, out Fido jumped
from the wagon to chase after the cat.</p>

<p>Fido didn’t want to catch her, you understand. Oh, no;
he just wanted to see if he could run as fast as the pussy was
running. So that’s why he jumped out of the wagon.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! There goes our dog!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, Fido is running away!” exclaimed Johnny sorrowfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Oh, we must get him, or he’ll be lost again!” cried Mary.
“Stop the wagon, please, Mr. Policeman, and we’ll get Fido
back again. Come here, Fido!” she called.</p>

<p>Well, the policeman wasn’t going to stop the wagon, but
just then a trolley car got in the way of it, and the driver
had to stop, whether he wanted to or not. And that was
just the chance the Trippertrots wanted.</p>

<p>First, Mary jumped out of the wagon, and then Tommy
jumped out, and then Johnny jumped out.</p>

<p>“Come back! Come back!” cried the policeman. “You’ll
be lost again, and I’ll have to find you.”</p>

<p>“We’re—going—to—get—our—Fido!” panted Mary.</p>

<p>And then, before the big, kind policeman could get out
of the wagon, those three children had hurried around a
corner of the street and were racing after Fido, and Fido
was racing after the pussy cat, and there was such a crowd
of people that the policeman couldn’t see the children, even
when he put on his glasses.</p>

<p>“My! My!” he exclaimed. “They will be lost again!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER THREE<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE HAND-ORGAN MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh, do</span> you s’pose we’ll ever catch that dog?” asked
Mary Trippertrot of her two brothers, as they raced along
after Fido, and Fido was chasing after the cat.</p>

<p>“Of course we will,” answered Tommy.</p>

<p>“And maybe we’ll get the pussy cat, too,” said Johnny,
who couldn’t run so very fast, as his legs were rather short.</p>

<p>“But we don’t want the cat,” spoke Mary. “For you
see, she and Fido aren’t very well acquainted yet, and they
might not like each other. I think we’ll just catch Fido,
and then we’ll all go home and get something for him to
eat. I’m sure he must be hungry. I know I am.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t know where our home is,” panted Johnny,
as he tripped along beside Tommy.</p>

<p>“Why, you silly boy, we can go back to the policeman
in the wagon, and he’ll find our home for us,” went on Mary.
“Come on, now. We are catching up to Fido.”</p>

<p>So on the Trippertrot children tripped and trotted as fast
as they could. And, all of a sudden, Mary slipped, and she
would have fallen down, only Johnny caught her. And then
Tommy was running so fast that he ran right into a lady who
was carrying a basket full of loaves of bread, and the bread
all bounced out on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, me! Oh, my!” cried the lady. “Now
see what you have done!”</p>

<p>“We are very sorry,” said Tommy politely. “But you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
see we are lost, and our dog Fido is lost, too, only we know
where he is, and we’re chasing after him, and he’s chasing
after a cat, and that’s how I happened to run into you. But
we’ll help you pick up the bread, though Fido may get so
far ahead of us that we can’t find him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my! What a lot of things to happen to three little
children!” said the lady kindly. “Never mind about the
bread. I can pick it up myself. You run on after your Fido,
bless your hearts!”</p>

<p>So she began to pick up the bread herself, and a man
helped her, and the Trippertrots ran on. And about a minute
after that Johnny stubbed his toe, but he didn’t even cry
half a tear, for he was a brave little fellow.</p>

<p>And then they hurried on again, and they could just see
Fido’s wagging tail now, and it was going around in a circle
like a merry-go-round, because, you see, he was so excited.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Mary. “Hurry up, and we’ll have
him in a minute!”</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Tommy. “The cat has run up a
tree, and now Fido can’t get her, so he’ll have to stop running,
and we can catch up to him.”</p>

<p>And would you ever believe it? That cat did run up a
tree, and she sat down on a branch, and Fido, he sat down
on the ground at the foot of the tree, for dogs can’t climb,
you know.</p>

<p>“Oh, you naughty Fido!” exclaimed Mary, as she came
up to him. “Why did you run away?” And Mary had to
sit down on the ground, too, so she could get her breath. And
then up came Tommy and Johnny, and they also had to
sit down, so there they all sat, the three Trippertrots and
the dog, at the foot of the tree, and the pussy cat about ten
feet up the tree, sitting on a branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Why did you run away?” asked Tommy, taking hold
of Fido’s left ear.</p>

<p>“Bow! wow! wow!” answered the doggie, which meant
that he didn’t know. Then he wagged his tail sideways on
the ground, and he made so much dust that Mary had to
sneeze.</p>

<p>And Johnny sneezed, and Tommy sneezed, and then
Fido sneezed, to keep them company. And the pussy cat
up the tree, she didn’t want to be left out, so she sneezed,
also, and in that way they all sneezed.</p>

<p>Then the three Trippertrots laughed, and the cat heard
them, and the pussy knew that anybody who laughs real jolly
like will never harm any animals, so the cat thought she
would come down out of the tree.</p>

<p>And she did. And what do you suppose Fido did? Why,
he just barked politely, as if he were saying, “Pleased to
meet you!” And he wagged his tail, real friendly like, and
he put his cold nose on the pussy cat’s cold nose, and that’s
the way they shook hands.</p>

<p>“Now they’re friends,” said Tommy. “I don’t see why
we can’t keep them both, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can,” said his sister, “as long as they don’t
quarrel. Come, Fido, we must go back to the kind policeman
now. Come, Pussy. I wonder what your name is?”</p>

<p>“Me-ow, me-ew!” cried the pussy.</p>

<p>“What did she say?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“I guess she said ‘How d’ do?’ But anyhow let’s call her
Ivy Vine, because she can climb a tree so well. Come, Ivy
Vine.”</p>

<p>So Fido got up, and so did the three Trippertrots, from
where they had been sitting on the ground, and Ivy Vine,
the pussy, got up also, and they all started down the street
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Do you know which way to go to get to the policeman’s
wagon?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“No. Don’t you?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>Tommy shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then we’re lost again,” said Mary, “for I don’t know
either. Oh, how many things are happening to us to-day!
I wonder if we will ever get home again?”</p>

<p>They looked all around, but they couldn’t see any street
that looked like the one they lived on, and there was no
house in sight like theirs, and they didn’t know what to do.
And then, all of a sudden, they heard some nice music. And
it was a hand-organ playing, and it played a tune called
“Always be happy and never be sad, Always be joyful and
jolly and glad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope that hand-organ man has a monkey!” cried
Mary.</p>

<p>And just then, surely enough, around the corner came
the hand-organ man, and he was playing the jolly tune, and
perched up on his organ was a cute little monkey, with a
red cap and a blue coat.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t this lovely!” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind being lost now,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>Then the hand-organ man came up to where the children
were standing, with Fido and the pussy cat. And at
first the monkey acted as if he wanted to run away from
the dog, but Fido wagged his tail so very friendly like that
the monkey stayed. And then the children noticed that the
hand-organ man looked sick, and he could hardly grind out
the music.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Mr. Hand-Organ Man?” asked
Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am very tired and lonesome,” said the man. “I
have walked about all day, and played all the tunes in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
hand-organ, but no one gave me any pennies. Not even
when Fuzzo, my monkey, climbed up to the second-story
windows and took off his cap. Oh, dear, I haven’t any money
to buy my supper with!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” exclaimed Tommy. “Maybe we
can help you.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Johnny. “We can go around with you, and
sing while you grind the organ, and we’ll take Ivy Vine and
Fido with us, and perhaps when the people see all the animals
together they may give you pennies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it would be very kind if you would do that,” said the
hand-organ man. So he began to play a jolly little tune,
and the children sang, and the monkey danced up on top of the
organ, and Fido stood on his hind legs, and Ivy Vine, the
cat, turned somersaults.</p>

<p>Well, you ought to have seen the crowd of people stop
and look on. Everybody laughed, and thought the children
were very cute, and they liked the animals, too. Then Fuzzo,
the monkey, took off his red cap and held it out, and the
people put a lot of pennies in it.</p>

<p>“Fine! Fine!” cried the hand-organ man as he heard
the pennies rattling in Fuzzo’s cap. “Now I can buy some
supper.” And more pennies came rattling in, until the cap
could not hold them all, and Fuzzo had to put some of them
in his pocket.</p>

<p>Well, the Trippertrot children were having a good time,
and in spite of being lost they were very happy, because they
were helping some one, and the organ man was playing another
tune, and Mary was just getting ready to sing a song
all alone, when a great big automobile dashed up to the sidewalk,
and the man who was in it cried:</p>

<p>“Why, bless my soul! If there aren’t the Trippertrots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
nearly two miles from home! I must take them back at
once. How did you get here, children?” he called.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s Mr. Johnson in his auto!” exclaimed Mary.
“We are lost, Mr. Johnson. Will you please take us home?”
For you see the man in the automobile happened to live next
door to the Trippertrots, and he knew them.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll take you home,” he said kindly. “Get in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we must take Fido and Ivy Vine, and Fuzzo
and the hand-organ man,” said Tommy. “Fido is our lost
dog, and Ivy Vine is our lost cat, and Fuzzo is the monkey.
We don’t know the man’s name, but he isn’t lost, neither is
Fuzzo, but they are very hungry, and we are going to take
them to our house for supper.”</p>

<p>“What! Take you and those animals and the hand-organ
man in my auto?” cried Mr. Johnson, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the hand-organ, too,” said Mary. “Then the
man can play tunes on the way, and you won’t have to blow
your horn. Get in, Fido. Get in, Ivy Vine. Get in, Fuzzo.
And you, too, Tommy and Johnny, and Mr. Hand-Organ
Man.”</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson laughed, and then he thought the best thing
to do would be to take the Trippertrots and everybody and
everything that they wanted along with him in the auto.</p>

<p>So they all piled into the car, and away they went; and,
surely enough, the hand-organ man played tunes all the way
along, and the people in the street laughed when they saw
the automobile with its queer load. But the Trippertrots
didn’t care, and soon they were right in front of their own
house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER FOUR<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE FUNNY HORSES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mrs. Trippertrot looked out of her window and
saw her three children, and Mr. Johnson, the man who owned
the automobile, and Fido the dog, and Ivy Vine the cat, and
Fuzzo the monkey—to say nothing of the hand-organ man—when
she saw all of them in front of her house she didn’t
know what to think.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear children!” she cried. “I have been looking
everywhere for you! Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“We have been lost, mamma,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“And we had a most lovely time!” exclaimed Johnny,
laughing.</p>

<p>“And we’ve got a dog and a cat, and a monkey!” added
Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried their mamma. “I’ve been telephoning
all over for you. I didn’t know what to do, and I have just
sent for your papa.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” said Tommy. “Really, we didn’t want
to worry you, mamma. But if papa hurries home, he can
have supper with the hand-organ man.”</p>

<p>“Have supper with the hand-organ man!” cried Mrs.
Trippertrot. “What in the world do you mean?”</p>

<p>“This is the hand-organ man,” said Mary, and she pointed
to the man who owned Fuzzo the monkey. “He’s very hungry,
and we helped him get some pennies. Mr. Johnson
found us, didn’t you, Mr. Johnson?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“I certainly did,” he said, and then he looked to see if he
had to pump any more wind into his big automobile tires.</p>

<p>“But a policeman found us first,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Only we jumped out of the wagon to go after Fido, for
he was chasing a cat,” explained Tommy. “Here is the cat,
mamma. Her name is Ivy Vine, because she can climb a
tree so good.”</p>

<p>“Bless us!” said Mrs. Trippertrot. “I shall never understand
all this. Oh, I hope you children never run away again.
I am ever so much obliged to you, Mr. Johnson, for bringing
them home. But what shall I do with a monkey and a
dog and a cat and a hand-organ man?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Johnson, “I think I would give the
hand-organ man and his monkey something to eat, and send
them away. Then I’d let the children keep the dog and cat
for a while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re going to keep them forever,” said Mary, “and
the monkey, too; can’t we, mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t ask me!” cried Mrs. Trippertrot. “Yes,
you may keep anything, as long as you don’t run away again.
Oh! I have been so worried about you!”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, but I can’t stay here,” said the hand-organ
man. “I must go home, for I am going to teach Fuzzo,
my monkey, a new trick of standing on his head, and then
perhaps we may get many more pennies. I thank your children
very much for what they did for me.” And then, making
a low bow to Mrs. Trippertrot, and to Mr. Johnson, he
climbed down out of the auto and took his hand-organ and
monkey and started away with them.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want some supper?” asked Tommy quickly.</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” said the man. “Since you were so
kind as to help me get some pennies, I can buy enough for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Fuzzo and myself to eat. So I’ll say good-by.” And then
the hand-organ man hurried away.</p>

<p>Soon Tommy and Mary and Johnny got out of the auto,
and kissed their mamma, and they went into the house, after
thanking Mr. Johnson for bringing them home, and Fido
and Ivy Vine went in with them.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what your papa will say about keeping
those animals,” said Mrs. Trippertrot, “but he will soon be
home, and we can ask him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll let us keep them,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Sure, for he loves dogs,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“And cats, too!” cried Tommy, for just then Ivy Vine
was purring away like a sewing machine, and washing her
fur, in front of the open fire in the library.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Mr. Trippertrot came home, and when he
heard about what his children had done, and how they had
been lost, and how they had brought home a cat and a dog
and a monkey, to say nothing of a hand-organ man, he didn’t
know what to say.</p>

<p>“But I suppose they may keep the dog and cat,” he said.
“They will be good pets for them. But I hope you never
run away again, children.”</p>

<p>Of course Mary and Tommy and Johnny promised, but
you just wait and see what happened. It was quite an adventure.</p>

<p>One afternoon, about three days later, the three Trippertrot
children were up in the playroom, having a soldier game.
Tommy was the general, and he had a sword; and Johnny
was a soldier, with a make-believe wooden gun; and Mary
was a nurse, to take care of the soldiers when they were ill.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just wish we had horses!” cried Johnny suddenly.
“Then we could take a long ride.”</p>

<p>“That <i>would</i> be fun,” said Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Could I ride, too?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“If we could find you a horse,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“Well, we have your old hobby-horse,” said Mary to
Tommy, “and down in the laundry is a clothes-horse. I could
have that.”</p>

<p>“But what could I have?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” cried Mary. “A sawhorse! The very
thing!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean a horse that is all sawed up into sawdust?”
asked Johnny, trying to stand on his head.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” replied his sister. “A sawhorse is something
a carpenter uses on which to saw out boards. It has
a back and four legs, just like a real horse. Oh, I know
what we’ll do! We’ll get the sawhorse and the clothes-horse
and the rocking-horse all out on the lawn, and we’ll put empty
thread spools under them for wheels, and we can really make-believe
truly ride.”</p>

<p>“Great!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“They are funny horses,” said Mary, “but we can have
some fun, and, who knows? perhaps we may ride to fairyland
on them. Come on, boys, we’ll get them ready.”</p>

<p>So they took the rocking-horse out of the playroom and
carried it out on the lawn. Then they brought the clothes-horse
up from the laundry.</p>

<p>The clothes-horse, you know, is the horse on which the
washlady hangs the clothes to dry in front of the fire. And
then those funny Trippertrot children went next door, where
a man was building a new house, and one of the carpenters
let them take a sawhorse. So they had three horses, you

</figure>

<p>Mary took a board and put it across the clothes-horse, so
she could sit on it to ride. But Tommy and Johnny didn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>need any boards for their horses. Tommy had the sawhorse,
and Johnny the rocking-horse. Then they fastened some big,
empty thread spools on the bottom of the legs of their horses,
and they were all ready to ride off after some new adventures.</p>

<p>They took their funny horses to the top of a little hill on
the smooth grassy lawn, so they would start to roll down
easily. Then they all got up on the horses’ backs.</p>

<p>“Giddap!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“Gee-up!” cried Johnny.</p>

<p>“Trot along, clothes-horse!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>And then, would you believe it? those funny horses began
to roll down the long, grassy hill. Faster and faster they
went on the spools, rolling along, bumpity-bump.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Mary. “Why, my horse is going!”</p>

<p>“And so is mine!” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Of course!” cried Tommy. “Horses always go.”</p>

<p>Faster and faster went the funny horses. The children
were hanging to them tightly, so as not to fall off.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t this great!” said Mary. “I wonder where they
will take us?”</p>

<p>“To fairyland, of course,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>By this time the funny horses, carrying the Trippertrot
children, were at the bottom of the lawn. They were galloping
along quite fast, when, all of a sudden, Mary cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, look! The brook! The brook!”</p>

<p>Right ahead of them was a little stream of water, and it
was quite wet water, too, let me tell you.</p>

<p>“Oh! If we fall in that, we’ll be drowned!” said Johnny,
shivering.</p>

<p>“Stop the horses! Stop them!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>So they all pulled on the pieces of string which they had
tied on the rocking-horse, and on the sawhorse, and on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
clothes-horse, for driving reins. But, would you believe it?
those funny horses never stopped at all.</p>

<p>Along they went on the empty spool-wheels, until they
were right at the edge of the brook; and then, instead of
stopping to get a drink, the way real horses would have done,
those strange horses just tumbled into the water. Right in
they tumbled, Trippertrot children and all.</p>

<p>“Oh!” screamed Mary, as she felt the water coming up
over her toes.</p>

<p>“Oh, me!” cried Johnny, as he felt the water on his nose.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” exclaimed Tommy, as some water splashed up
on his knees. “We’ll be drowned!”</p>

<p>But I’m not going to let anything like that happen to our
Trippertrots. No, indeed. I’m going to save them. Just
listen.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, when the three children were in the
water—all of a sudden, I say—the clothes-horse and the sawhorse
and the rocking-horse sort of floated close to each other,
and all at once they made themselves into a nice raft, that
was just as good as a sailboat.</p>

<p>“Climb up, and we’ll have a ride in the brook!” cried
Johnny, when he saw that the funny wooden horses would
hold them all, and not let them sink.</p>

<p>So the three children climbed up on the funny boat, that
was made from the funny horses, and they sat there a little
while until they were nice and warm and dry again, and
then the sawhorse and the clothes-horse and the rocking-horse
just swam toward shore as fast as they could, and so the children
were saved, just as I told you they would be.</p>

<p>And then—well, if you want to know what happened after
that, will you please turn to the next page, and then you can

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER FIVE<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE OLD FISHERMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> of a sudden, as the Trippertrot children were riding
along on their funny horses, which had just galloped up out
of the water to the dry land—all of a sudden, I say—Mary
happened to look behind her, and there was Ivy Vine, the
cat, running after them as fast as she could run, and her tail
was sticking straight up in the air, like a clothes-post.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Mary. “Ivy Vine is coming, and she
may get lost!”</p>

<p>“So might we get lost, if we go far enough,” answered
Johnny. “We’d better wait for Ivy Vine, and she can show
us the way home.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” added Tommy. “We were lost once, and
I don’t want it to happen again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was nothing,” said Mary. “I think it was fun
to be lost. Remember the good time we had.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look over there!” suddenly called Johnny. “There
comes Fido, our dog! Now, surely we can’t get lost with
him along. I say, let’s get off our horses and take a walk.
My horse is tired, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“And so is mine,” said Mary. “Maybe if we walk along
real slowly we’ll have an adventure.”</p>

<p>Then, pretty soon, up came Ivy Vine, the cat, and Fido,
the dog, and, leaving their three funny horses in the grass,
the Trippertrots and the dog and the cat started off. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
walked along and along, and pretty soon they came to a little
hill.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up this hill, and see what’s on top,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes. Maybe a nice fairy lives there,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, don’t go up,” objected Mary. “We might fall down
on the other side.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Johnny. “I don’t want to fall down,
because I’ve got on a new pair of stockings, and mamma
doesn’t want me to get any holes in them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are too fussy,” spoke Tommy. “Why, we don’t
have to fall down the other side. And besides, if we
do start to slip, we can grab hold of Ivy Vine’s tail, and she
can stick her sharp claws down in the grass on the hill, and
we won’t slide any more.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I never thought of that,” said Mary. “We’ll
go up. Come on, Ivy Vine, I’m going to hold you, so if I
happen to slip you can save me.”</p>

<p>“And Johnny and I will take Fido,” said Tommy. “His
toenails aren’t as sharp as Ivy Vine’s, but he’ll do, I guess.”</p>

<p>So up the hill they went, slowly and carefully, with the
dog and the cat, and they kept a close watch on every side,
but they didn’t see any fairies, though in one place they saw
growing some toadstools, that fairies use for umbrellas when
it rains.</p>

<p>Then, presently, the Trippertrots were at the top of the
hill, and it was a nice, flat, smooth place, all covered with
grass; and they couldn’t have fallen off if they had tried with
all their might; no, indeed!</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, Mary happened to look behind
a tree that was growing on top of the hill, and she saw
a nice old man sitting in a chair, on the edge of a little lake
of water. Oh, he was a very old man, and he had such a
nice, pleasant face, though you couldn’t see very much of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
because he had so many whiskers. He had whiskers all over
him, almost like Santa Claus.</p>

<p>“Look!” whispered Mary to her brothers. “I wonder
who he is, and what he is doing?”</p>

<p>“I know what he’s doing,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“He’s a fisherman,” answered Johnny. “Can’t you see
his pole and line?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” spoke Mary. “But I wonder what he
is catching?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go up and ask him,” suggested Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, we mustn’t do that,” objected Johnny. “Fishermen
never like to be bothered when they’re catching fish.”</p>

<p>“But maybe he hasn’t caught any yet,” said Mary, “and,
of course, then he wouldn’t mind. We can go up to him,
and we’ll tell him that as soon as he begins to catch any fish
we’ll run away, and not bother him.”</p>

<p>“I guess that will do,” said Johnny. “Come on.”</p>

<p>So the three Trippertrot children walked softly up to the
old fisherman, and when he saw them coming he waved his
hand to them, not the hand that held the fishpole, you understand,
but his other one, and he smiled in a very kind way,
and said:</p>

<p>“Come right along, children. I heard what you said,
and you won’t annoy me a bit. I like children.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mary politely. “But if you catch any
fish we’ll go right away and not bother you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I never catch any fish,” said the old man, with
a jolly laugh. “I’ve fished for years and years, right here,
and never a fish have I caught.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Johnny. “We live near here, and
I don’t remember ever seeing you before.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Perhaps that is because you never happened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
look when I was sitting here,” said the man. “But you say
you live around here?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—I—er—I guess so,” said Mary slowly.</p>

<p>“Can’t you be sure?” asked the old fisherman.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Tommy. “You see, it’s this way.
We are the Trippertrots, and we’re always getting lost. We
start out somewhere, as we did to-day on our funny horses,
and we don’t seem to go very far at all, but all of a sudden
we’re lost. So we never know whether we’re near home or
not.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s that way now,” said Mary. “I don’t seem
to remember this place at all,” and she looked all around.
“It isn’t a bit like what I thought it was, and we didn’t seem
to come so very far; and anyhow, we only started out from
home a short while ago. But we’re lost, sure.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Tommy. “Fido or Ivy Vine will
show us the way home; or, if they can’t, perhaps this gentleman
will.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said the fisherman, pulling up his line and
looking at it, and then the children saw that instead of a regular
sharp fish-hook he had a big hammock-hook on the end
of his line.</p>

<p>“That’s a funny hook,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” agreed the old fisherman, with a jolly laugh.
“But I like it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s why you never catch any fish,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right,” agreed the old man, with another
jolly laugh. “I never thought of it in that way before,
but I believe that’s the reason.”</p>

<p>“But if you don’t catch fish, what do you catch?” asked
Mary, who was very curious.</p>

<p>“Oh, lots and lots of things!” exclaimed the fisherman. “It
would take me a long time to tell you, for they are such funny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
things. The best way for me to do would be to show you
what I catch. Now look at me carefully, and see what I
pull up this time on my hammock-hook.”</p>

<p>So the old fisherman carefully lowered his hook and line
into the little lake. Then he leaned back in his chair, and
the Trippertrots stood around him. The old man closed
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Ha! I have something!” he suddenly cried, and, quickly
pulling up his line, there, dangling on the hammock-hook,
was a pair of rubber boots.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing at all,” said the old fisherman. “Just
you wait and see what happens next. I catch very funny
things.”</p>

<p>So he put in his line again, just like Jack Horner put his
thumb in the pie. Then the old fisherman pulled it out
again—pulled out the line, you know, not Jack Horner’s
thumb—and this time, dangling on the hammock-hook, was
a nice rubber coat, such as children wear to school on rainy
days.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the old fisherman. “See what my next
catch will be.” And what do you suppose it was? Why,
when he pulled up his line the next time there was a big
umbrella on the hook!</p>

<p>“There! What did I tell you?” exclaimed the fisherman.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, before the Trippertrots could
say anything—all of a sudden, I say—it began to rain. How
it did pour! The drops splashed down all over, and made
the grass quite wet.</p>

<p>“Oh! Whatever shall we do?” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried the old fisherman. “Tommy, you put on
the rubber boots and the rubber coat, and Johnny, you take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the umbrella, and hold it over you and Mary. It’s big enough
for two children. Lively now, and then run as fast as you
can.”</p>

<p>“Where shall we run?” asked Tommy, as he put on the
rubber boots.</p>

<p>“Run anywhere,” answered the old fisherman. “Anywhere.
It doesn’t matter, as long as you get in out of the
rain. Run! Run! I’ll run, too!” And catching up his
chair in one hand, and his fishpole in the other, he ran as fast
as he could after the children.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just know we’ll be lost again!” cried Mary sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Tommy. “This is jolly fun!”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” agreed Johnny. “Maybe we’ll have
another adventure. Come on, Ivy Vine and Fido.”</p>

<p>So on they ran, the Trippertrots and the old fisherman
and the dog and cat; on and on through the rain, which kept
coming down harder and harder, until pretty soon they saw
a little house in the woods.</p>

<p>“Who lives there?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“The false-face man,” said the old fisherman. “Come on.
We’ll go in there out of the wet.”</p>

<p>So they started for the house of the false-face man, and
they wondered what would happen when they got there.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER SIX<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE FALSE-FACE MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh, my!</span> It’s raining harder than ever!” cried Mary
Trippertrot, as she and her brothers and the old fisherman
ran along. “Can’t you please hold that umbrella over me
better than that, Johnny? I’m getting all wet.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” spoke the kind old fisherman, and he held
the chair upside down over his head, so his whiskers wouldn’t
get full of water. “Never mind. We’ll soon be in the false-face
man’s house, and we can get good and dry.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he is at home?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Who? The false-face man?” inquired the old fisherman.
“Of course he’s at home. He’s never anywhere else.
He never goes out, you know. Why, who would make all
the false-faces if he went away? He just can’t spare the
time, you see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it must be dreadful to have to stay in the house all
the while!” said Mary. “I wouldn’t like it a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the fisherman, as he tried to run in between
the big rain-drops so he wouldn’t get hit by them, “there is
one good thing about staying home all the while—you never
get lost.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Tommy. “But we’d better hurry.
My boots are full of water, and my feet are wet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” exclaimed the fisherman. “I forgot
about the water in the boots. I wonder how it got in?”</p>

<p>“Why, you fished them up out of the lake,” said Johnny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
“and I think it must have gotten in over the tops that way.
They were down under water, you know.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said the old fisherman. “The next time
I catch rubber boots I’m going to have the tops covered over
with shingles so the water won’t get in. But I see the false-face
man waving to us, and that means he’s at home, and he
wants us to hurry in. Run a little faster, children.”</p>

<p>So the Trippertrots ran faster, and so did Ivy Vine, the
cat, for she didn’t like the wet very much; and neither did
Fido, the dog; but they didn’t say anything about it. And
the old fisherman ran, also.</p>

<p>Mary and Tommy and Johnny looked toward the little
house to see what kind of a person the false-face man was.
He was standing in the doorway. And he was quite a jolly
sort of a man, if you will kindly take my word for it. He
had on an apron all covered with spots of paint, and his arms,
on which the sleeves were rolled up almost to the shoulders,
had paint on them also. The children could see him quite
plainly now, for all of a sudden the sky cleared up, though
the ground was still very wet.</p>

<p>“Leave the umbrella, chair, coat and rubber boots here,”
said the old fisherman. “We won’t need them, as it has
stopped raining.”</p>

<p>So they put them down in the grass and hurried on.</p>

<p>And oh, so many, many pretty colors as the children saw!
There were red spots on the false-face man, and green spots
of paint, and pink spots, and black spots, and yellow, and
brown, and purple, and gold, and silver, and even some
chimney-colored spots. It was just as if a rainbow had
splattered over him.</p>

<p>“Why is he all spotted up that way?” asked Mary, as she
and Johnny splashed into a puddle and out again.</p>

<p>“Because he paints the false-faces,” said the old fisherman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“He paints them all sorts of colors, and, of course,
some of the paint splashes on him. But bless you! he doesn’t
mind it in the least; not in the least, I do assure you.”</p>

<p>“Does he make <i>all</i> the false-faces?” asked Tommy, as he
stepped along.</p>

<p>“Everyone,” answered the old fisherman. “All those
faces you see in the store windows for Hallowe’en. Wait.
I’ll have him tell you about it.”</p>

<p>So they ran on, and now they were right at the front door
of the house of the false-face man, and they could see that
he was even more jolly-looking than they had at first thought.</p>

<p>“Don’t you make all the false-faces?” the old fisherman
asked him, as he pointed to some of them hanging on the
house. “Please tell the children all about it.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” said the false-face man, with a jolly
laugh. “I have just finished making a whole lot of false-faces
for the children all over this country, and for some out
in a city called Orange; but I think that must be a funny
place. I wonder why they didn’t call it Lemon?”</p>

<p>“Because, if you please,” said Mary, “I think it was because
lemons are sour.”</p>

<p>“Ha! I never thought of that!” exclaimed the false-face
man. “No doubt you are right. But come in. Don’t mind
the paint. It won’t come off, for it’s dry by this time.”</p>

<p>“I wish <i>we</i> were dry,” said old fisherman, as he twisted
his whiskers around to squeeze the water out of them. “<i>We</i>
are very wet, even if the paint isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, come in, and you may sit by the fire,” said the
false-face man. “I’m very glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“And will you really tell us about making the false-faces,
if you please?” asked Tommy politely.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” was the answer. “Do you mind
if I sing it?” and the false-face man looked at the children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and then at Ivy Vine, who was trying to get her fur dry
with her red tongue.</p>

<p>“No. I think they would like very much to hear you
sing,” spoke the old fisherman.</p>

<p>“Do you think the dog or cat would mind?” went on
the false-face man. “Some dogs don’t like music.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe they would mind your singing,” said
Tommy, and the false-face man and the old fisherman began
to laugh, though the Trippertrots didn’t know why.</p>

<p>“Well, then, here goes for the song,” said the false-face
man after a while. “It’s not a very good one, as I made it
up myself, but it’s the best I can do. And I’ll sing it to the
tune of Hum-dum-dum diddle-iddle-um.”</p>

<p>Then he sang this song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“I am the false-est facer man</div>
<div class="indent">That ever you have seen.</div>
<div class="verse">I make false-faces colored red,</div>
<div class="indent">And also colored green.</div>
<div class="verse">I make an elephant’s false-face,</div>
<div class="indent">And then I go and make</div>
<div class="verse">A false-face for a mooley-cow</div>
<div class="indent">Who’s eating jelly cake.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“I’ll make false-faces for you all,</div>
<div class="indent">If you will kindly wait;</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll make one for the soup dish,</div>
<div class="indent">And for the butter plate.</div>
<div class="verse">And then we’ll have a party,</div>
<div class="indent">The funniest ever seen,</div>
<div class="verse">For we’ll all have false-faces</div>
<div class="indent">To wear on Hallowe’en.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“I think that is a very nice song,” said Mary, when the
false-face man had finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Thank you,” replied the false-face man, making a low
bow.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” cried Tommy. “When is Hallowe’en?”</p>

<p>“To-night,” answered the old fisherman.</p>

<p>“And will you really make false-faces for all of us?” inquired
Johnny.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” said the false-face man, “and I’ll
make one for Ivy Vine, and for Fido the dog. Then we’ll
have a party, just as I sung about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I forgot!” exclaimed Mary. “We can’t stay to
any Hallowe’en party.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Because we’re lost,” said his sister. “We must try to
find our way back home, or mamma and papa will be alarmed
about us.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said the two boys.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry,” spoke the false-face man. “I think
I can find your home for you after a while, and it is early
yet.”</p>

<p>That made the children feel better, and they thought they
might stay just a little while longer; anyway, until they got
their false-faces.</p>

<p>“Now, what kind of faces do you want?” asked the man,
who was all covered with paint spots.</p>

<p>“I want an Indian’s!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” said the false-face man.</p>

<p>“And I want one like Little Jack Horner, who sat in the
corner,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” said the false-face man, with a jolly
laugh, “and you may sit in the corner of my shop here, and
perhaps we can find a Christmas pie so you can put in your
thumb and pull out a plum.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be jolly!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“And now what kind of a false-face do you want, Mary?”
asked the old fisherman.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I would like one of Old Mother Hubbard
who went to the cupboard,” said the little Trippertrot girl.</p>

<p>“And you may have that,” promised the false-face man.
“And I have a cupboard, and you have the dog, so if we can
find a bone the cupboard won’t be bare.”</p>

<p>Then he gave the children their false-faces, and he found
a bone for Fido, who barked three times, to say thank you;
and there was some milk for Ivy Vine. Then the children
put on their false-faces, and there was one for Fido. He
was dressed up like a monkey; and as for Ivy Vine, she had
a false-face like a wax doll, and she was very cute-looking.</p>

<p>And the false-face man didn’t need any false-face himself,
as he was all covered over with paint, anyhow. And whom
do you suppose the old fisherman dressed up like? Why,
who else but Santa Claus, and he wore his own whiskers.
Then they had a party, and Johnny put his thumb in a pie
and pulled out a whole bag full of sugar plums. Oh, they
were just having the grandest time, when, all of a sudden,
there came a knock on the door!</p>

<p>“Ha! I wonder who that can be?” asked the false-face
man.</p>

<p>“I’ll look,” said the old fisherman.</p>

<p>So he looked, and who should be there but the Trippertrots’
nursemaid, Suzette.</p>

<p>“Oh, children!” exclaimed Suzette, when she saw them.
“You must come home at once! I have been looking everywhere
for you! Your mamma is much worried. Come home
at once!”</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean to run away,” said Mary, “but the sawhorse
and the clothes-horse and the rocking-horse got going
so fast that we couldn’t stop them. So we got lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“But we’re not lost now, any more!” exclaimed Tommy,
as the nursemaid walked into the house.</p>

<p>“And here is a little present for Suzette,” spoke the false-face
man, as he gave her a face that looked like a Chinese
lady, with a pigtail down her back.</p>

<p>And then, when the children had said good-by to their
two friends, the fisherman and the false-face man, they started
home with Suzette, taking Ivy Vine and Fido with them, and
also their false-faces.</p>

<p>But they hadn’t been home very long before they ran
away again, and then they had another adventure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER SEVEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE LITTLE OLD LADY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Mrs. Trippertrot called to her three children.</p>

<p>“Now, children,” she said, “I am going out for a little
while, and I do hope you will not trot off anywhere this time.
You don’t know how worried I am when you run off, as you
have done several times lately.”</p>

<p>“We’re sorry, mamma,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“And we don’t ever really mean to trot off,” said Mary
Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“It—it just seems to happen,” spoke Johnny Trippertrot.
“Our legs run off with us before we know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, try and not let them run off with you to-day,”
said their mamma. “I will leave Suzette in charge of you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to be good, mamma,” said Mary politely.</p>

<p>“But, oh! we did have such fun the other day when we
rode off on the funny horses!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, when we met the false-face man and the old fisherman,”
added Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what let’s do!” cried Mary. “We’ll get
out our false-faces and play it’s Hallowe’en again.”</p>

<p>“That will be nice, I think,” said their mamma, “and it
ought to keep you in the house. I’ll be back as soon as I
can.”</p>

<p>So off she went, downtown shopping, I guess, and the
children got out their funny false-faces, and played some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
games. They were having a good time, when, all at once,
they heard some one out in the street crying.</p>

<p>“I wonder who that is?” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Let’s go look,” suggested Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, you had better not,” said Suzette the maid. “For
it might be a funny monkey, and then you would want to
go off after it, and you would be lost again. You had better
stay here and play at having a surprise party.”</p>

<p>Well, the children didn’t want to do that, but they knew
they must mind Suzette, for she was in charge of them. But
just then something happened. The delivery wagon came
from the big downtown store, and Suzette had to go down to
the side door to take in some things for the children’s mamma.
Then Mary and Tommy and Johnny heard the crying noise
out in the street again, and Mary said:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it would do any harm to take just one
peep, to see who is crying.”</p>

<p>“Me, either,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it,” said Johnny, and they did. They went
to the front window and looked out. And this is what the
children saw:</p>

<p>There was a tiny little girl walking along, and she had
fallen down, and her knee had been cut on a sharp stone,
and that’s why she was crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, see the poor thing!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“We ought to help her,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it,” suggested Tommy. “Suzette or
mamma wouldn’t care if we helped somebody in trouble.
Mamma would want us to, I’m sure. Besides, mamma isn’t
here now, and neither is Suzette.” For you see, the nursemaid
was still talking to the delivery boy. He had forgotten
to bring a spool of thread that Mrs. Trippertrot needed,
and Suzette was asking about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“We’ll go down to the little girl,” said Mary. “We can’t
get lost in front of our own house.”</p>

<p>So down they went, and I just want you to listen, and see
what happened after that. It just goes to show that you
never, never can tell what is going to happen in this world.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, little girl?” asked Mary, after she
had wiped the child’s tears away with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Oh! Boo-hoo! I’m lost!” cried the little girl. “I
went to the store for a stick of candy, but I came back the
wrong way, and I’m lost.”</p>

<p>“Where is the stick of candy?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“I ate it all up,” said the little lost girl. “Look! You
can’t see it.” And she opened her mouth so the Trippertrots
could see away down her throat, and believe me, there wasn’t
a bit of candy to be seen!</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s all gone,” said Johnny sorrowfully, when he got
through looking.</p>

<p>“Say, do you know what I think we ought to do?” spoke
Tommy suddenly.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Mary and Johnny.</p>

<p>“We ought to take this little lost girl home. We’d want
some one to take us home if we were lost, and I don’t believe
mamma or Suzette would mind.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, either,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it,” said Tommy. “Do you know which
street you live on?” he asked of the little girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. It’s a street with trees on it,” said the child,
and now she stopped crying. “Please take me to it.”</p>

<p>“There are lots of streets with trees on,” said Tommy, “but
we’ll try to find the right one for you. Come on.”</p>

<p>And so that’s how the Trippertrots started tripping and
trotting off again, and at the beginning they didn’t really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
mean to do so at all. But you see how some very funny things
happen sometimes.</p>

<p>Along they walked, all four children together, hand in
hand, looking for the house where the little lost girl lived.
Ivy Vine, the cat, didn’t come along this time, nor did Fido,
the dog. For Ivy Vine was washing her face with her red
tongue, and Fido was gnawing a bone.</p>

<p>“What is your name, little girl?” asked Mary, when they
had gone a short distance down the street.</p>

<p>“My name is Jack,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Why, that is not a girl’s name, it’s a boy’s!” said Tommy
in surprise.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said the little lost girl, “and I <i>want</i> to be
a boy, so I choosed a boy’s name. My mamma lets me, and
when I grow up I’m going to ride a horse and play football.”</p>

<p>The Trippertrot children laughed at that, and they thought
the little girl who wanted to be a boy was very nice. But
still they couldn’t seem to find her home. They looked all
over for her house, and every time they came to a street with
trees on it they asked her if it was there she lived, but she
said:</p>

<p>“No, none of these houses are my papa’s house. I guess
we’ll have to go on a little farther.”</p>

<p>So they went on a little farther, but still they couldn’t
seem to find the place, and the little girl said:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I guess I’m lost still, aren’t I?” And she
took a tighter hold of Mary Trippertrot’s hand.</p>

<p>“I guess you are,” answered Mary.</p>

<p>“And I guess <i>we</i> are, too,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just what I was afraid would happen,” said
Johnny. “Here we are lost again, and we promised mamma
we wouldn’t go out of the house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we really didn’t <i>mean</i> to,” said Mary; “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
besides, she’ll forgive us when she knows we tried to do a
kindness.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so,” said Tommy, “but what are we going
to do? I don’t know which way to go.”</p>

<p>Neither did any of the others, and Mary was just looking
around, hoping she could find a nice policeman, when,
all at once, the door of a house, in front of which they were
standing, opened, and a kind little old lady looked out.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor, dear, little lost children!” she exclaimed.
“Come right in here, and let me love you.”</p>

<p>“How did you know we were lost?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was once a little girl myself,” said the nice little
old lady, and, though her hair was white, her eyes were as
bright as the snapping fire on a cold night. “So I know when
children are lost,” she added.</p>

<p>So the little lost girl and the Trippertrots, who were also
lost now, went into the house of the little old lady. She
brought out some nice low chairs for them to sit on, and
she gave them some picture books to look at, and then what
do you think she did? Why, she went out and got them
some bowls of milk from a mooley-cow—the milk was from
the cow, you know, not the bowls—and she brought some
bread; and say! I just wish I had some of that bread and
milk myself! Oh, it was very good! But I can’t have any,
because the Trippertrots and the lost girl finished it all up,
down to the last drop, and they ate some sugar cookies, too.</p>

<p>“My, I’m sure I don’t know what to do with you children,”
said the little old lady, shaking her white head at them,
after they had finished eating. “I wish I knew where your
home was.”</p>

<p>“Send for a policeman,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“What! A policeman? Why, you’re not bad, are you?”
cried the little old lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Oh, no! But policemans most always know where we
live,” said Johnny. “We’re the Trippertrots, and we’re always
getting lost.”</p>

<p>“Yes, send for a policeman,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“I believe I will,” spoke the little old lady. “I’ll go for
one myself; but I’ll have to leave you here all alone, as no
one lives with me. But I know you’ll be all right, and you
can look at the pictures and listen to the cat purring.”</p>

<p>And sure enough, there was a big gray cat sleeping on
the rug in the middle of the floor, and it was purring just like
a sewing machine because it was so happy. The cat was
happy, not the sewing machine, you know. And the cat
purred, not the rug, you see.</p>

<p>Then the little old lady put on her bonnet and shawl, and
went out for a policeman who might find the homes of the
lost Trippertrots and the lost girl.</p>

<p>“I like it here very much,” said Mary, as she rubbed the
cat’s back.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said the little lost girl. “It is almost as nice
as my home.”</p>

<p>Tommy and Johnny liked it, too, and they were just looking
at some picture books, and wishing they had more bread
and milk, when, all at once, there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“I guess that is the policeman, come to take us home,”
said Mary, with a happy laugh.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s my papa,” suggested the little lost girl named
Jack. And then the door opened, and there stood a funny
little man, making low bows to the children, and saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad I found you. Come with me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER EIGHT<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE LITTLE OLD MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few seconds after he had opened the door and spoken
to the Trippertrot children, the queer little old man didn’t
say anything more. He just stood there, bowing all the while,
just like the pendulum of the clock, only he went up and down,
and the pendulum in the clock goes sideways, you see.</p>

<p>“Well, are you coming along, children?” said the nice little
old man, after a while, and he stopped bowing.</p>

<p>“Do you think we ought to go?” asked Mary of her two
brothers.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Tommy, “the little old lady has gone for
a policeman to take us home, and maybe we ought to wait
until she comes back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I can take you home as well as a policeman
could,” said the little old man, and he came into the room,
and tickled the pussy cat under the chin, and made the cat
purr louder than ever.</p>

<p>“Do you know where we live?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“No, but I can find out,” said the little old man. “I
will look in the telephone book, or in the directory book, or
something, and find your house for you. And if I can’t find
<i>your</i> house I will take you to <i>mine</i>, and you can have some
fun.”</p>

<p>“That will be nice,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“How did you know we were here?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Oh, I saw you come in,” replied the little old man. “I
was out in the street, and I saw you. Then I saw the little
old lady go away——”</p>

<p>“Yes, she went for a policeman for us,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Well, I was afraid she was going to run away and leave
you all alone,” said the little old man, “and as I like children
very much I thought I’d come and take care of you. So
here I am, and if you come with me before the policeman
gets here we’ll have a little fun with him. Maybe he’ll think
you have flown up the chimney, as Santa Claus does.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>And just then, all of a sudden, the little lost girl began
to cry.</p>

<p>“Why, whatever in the world is the matter?” asked the
little old man.</p>

<p>“Boo-hoo! I—I thought you were my papa,” said the
little lost girl, and she let some salty tears fall down on the
cat’s back. “I thought you were my papa, and you aren’t
at all.”</p>

<p>Then she cried a lot more, boo-hoo! and boo-hoo!—like
that, you know—and the little old man went up to her, and he
put his arms around her, and he wiped away her tears, and he
said:</p>

<p>“Now—now—never mind. It’s all right. I’m going to
take you to your papa right away. Don’t cry.” And his
voice was so gentle, and he seemed such a nice man, that the
little lost girl didn’t cry a single tear more. And it’s a good
thing, because the pussy cat was getting all wet from them,
and cats don’t like water, you know, especially salty tear
water.</p>

<p>“Come on, now; hurry up,” cried the little old man. “We
must hurry away from here, or the little old lady will be back
with the policeman before we know it. Come along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“But we can’t go without thanking her for being so kind
to us,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said the little man. “Wait. I’ll write her a
nice letter.” So he did that, and told the little old lady how
thankful the Trippertrots and the little lost girl were for
what she had done for them, and he put the letter down in
front of the pussy cat, where the little old lady would see it
when she got back. And the pussy put its paw down on the
letter, so it wouldn’t blow away, and then it went to sleep—I
mean the cat went to sleep, not the letter, you understand,
of course.</p>

<p>“Now we are all ready,” said the little old man, and then
he went out of the front door, and led the children down the
street.</p>

<p>A little while after that, when the little old man and the
children had turned around a corner, along came the little
old lady and the kind policeman. They went into the house,
and the lady looked all around for the children.</p>

<p>“Why, my goodness sakes alive!” she cried. “They’re
gone!”</p>

<p>“Gone, eh?” asked the policeman. “What were their
names?”</p>

<p>“The Trippertrots,” said the little old lady.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” laughed the policeman. “Then you don’t need
to worry. They are sure to be all right. They are always
getting lost, but they will get safely home again. Don’t
worry.”</p>

<p>So the little old lady didn’t worry very much, and the
policeman went away, and then the lady found the thankful
letter where the cat was sleeping on it.</p>

<p>“Oh, if the little old man has the children they are all
right,” said the little old lady, and then she gave the cat some
milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>But now I must tell you what happened to the Trippertrots
and the little lost girl. They walked along the street
with the nice, kind old man until pretty soon they came to a
place like a park, with beautiful trees in it, and little brooks
flowing over stones, and in the brooks were goldfishes and
some silver-fishes, too, and they were wiggling their tails, and
swimming about, looking for something to eat.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a lovely place!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes. What is it?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“I’d like to go in there,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“You may,” said the little old man. “This is a garden,
and a playground for boys and girls. You may do just as
you like, as long as you are kind and good and pleasant. And
I know you will be that way. So come on in, and have some
fun; and when you are through playing I’ll find where you
live, and take you home.”</p>

<p>“And me, too?” asked the little lost girl named Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes; you also,” answered the little old man.</p>

<p>So the children went into the beautiful garden. Oh! I
wish you could have seen it! And perhaps some day I will
be allowed to come around and take you all there in a fairy
automobile with big fat rubber tires. But not just yet.</p>

<p>Now, in this garden were many swings and hammocks,
and shady trees under which to rest, and there were little hills
all covered with grass, down which the children could roll
over and over, and never get hurt, any more than if they
rolled on a feather bed.</p>

<p>And there were also piles of sand in big boxes, and there
the Trippertrots and the little lost girl had lots of fun. They
made sand gardens and sand houses and castles, wherein lived
beautiful knights and princes and their ladies, and then there
was a place where a whole lot of soldiers could parade and
shoot off their make-believe guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>And the flower gardens! Oh, I wish you could have seen
them. Even though it was almost winter, the flowers were
in blossom, for the little old man knew how to make them
bloom in cold weather. And the children were allowed to
pick as many flowers as they wanted, only they thought they
looked prettier on their stems, so they didn’t take many.</p>

<p>Well, the Trippertrots were playing away, and having lots
of fun. Tommy was in the swing, and Johnny pushed him
up so high that Tommy nearly hit the top of a tree. And
then something happened. Mary was building a nice sand
house for a dollie to live in, when the house fell down and
covered her legs all up. Covered Mary’s legs, I mean, not
the doll’s. Mary couldn’t see her legs, and she thought they
might have dropped off.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she cried.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” called Tommy.</p>

<p>“My poor little legs!” said Mary, trying to pull them out
from under the sand.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all right,” spoke Johnny, and then he took
a piece of board and he dug the sand off Mary’s legs, and
she was all right again, and she made a big sand bridge for
boats to go under.</p>

<p>Soon out from his house in the beautiful garden came
running the funny little man. He was waving his arms all
around his head, like a windmill in a storm.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have found where you live! I have found where
you live!” he cried, in his jolly voice.</p>

<p>“Where who lives, us or that little girl named Jack?” asked
Tommy.</p>

<p>“I know where Jack lives,” said the little old man. “I
called up on the telephone and found out. Her papa is coming
for her in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie!” cried the little girl, jumping up and down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55-56]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“But what about us?” asked Mary Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“I’ll find where you live very soon,” said the little old
man. And just then the little lost girl’s papa came for her,
and took her home, after he had thanked the Trippertrots and
the little old man for being so kind to her.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, when the little old man was
calling up on the telephone, trying to find where the Trippertrots
lived—all of a sudden, I say—along came Suzette,
the nursemaid, looking for them.</p>

<p>“Oh, you children!” she cried, when she saw them in the
garden. “I thought I would never find you. Come home
at once. Why did you run away?”</p>

<p>“We went to help a little lost girl, and we got lost ourselves,”
said Mary; “but we didn’t mean to, did we, boys?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tommy and Johnny together. Then
Suzette thanked the little old man, and she took the children
home, and oh! how glad their mamma was to see them! And
they said they would never trot away again. But you just
wait and see what happens.</p>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE FIREMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after the Trippertrot children got home, following
their adventure with the little old man, their mamma
said to them:</p>

<p>“Now, children, I am going over to see your Aunt Mary
Jane, and I want you to stay in the house until I get back.
It is rather chilly out of doors, and it looks as if it might rain.
So stay in, play with your toys, or look at your picture books,
but don’t go out.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go out at all, mamma?” asked Mary Trippertrot,
as she looked in a glass to see if her hair ribbon was on
straight.</p>

<p>“No,” said her mother, as she looked in the glass to see
if her hat was on straight.</p>

<p>“Not even if the house should tumble down on us?” asked
Tommy Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“Well, if something most extraordinary like that happens,
you <i>may</i> run out,” said Mrs. Trippertrot, trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>“Of course,” spoke Johnny, “we wouldn’t want to be all
squashed up, like pancakes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just love pancakes—the kind you eat, I mean!”
exclaimed Mary. “May we have some, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I’ll see about it when I get back. Now good-by,”
she said to them, “and be good children, and don’t go
out unless you really have to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>So they promised, and they all crowded to the window
of the big front room to wave their hands to their mamma
as she went down the steps.</p>

<p>Then they began to play with their toys, and to look at
picture books, until pretty soon Mary said:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! This isn’t any fun!”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” agreed Tommy.</p>

<p>“I—I almost wish we could run away again, and get lost,”
said Johnny boldly.</p>

<p>“Oh-o-o-o-o-o!” exclaimed Mary. “You wouldn’t really
go tripping and trotting off again, would you?”</p>

<p>“I would, if something happened,” said Johnny, and he
tried to make all of his toy soldiers stand up in a line, but
they fell over and bumped their noses on the carpet, and one
soldier lost his sword. Then the children played circus for
a while, and Tommy was a make-believe elephant, who lived
in a cave under the big chair, until all at once Mary said:</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do. I’m going to ask Suzette
to build a nice fire in the open grate. Then we can sit and
watch the flames go up the chimney, and we can make-believe
we see pictures in them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be fine!” cried Tommy and Johnny.</p>

<p>So Suzette came in, and built a fine, big fire on the large
open brick hearth. And dear me! how the flames did roar
up the chimney! for Suzette put on a great deal of wood. It
burned and it blazed, and then, all of a sudden, the front doorbell
rang.</p>

<p>“There’s mamma come back!” cried Mary, as she ran to
open the door. Tommy and Johnny followed her, but instead
of Mrs. Trippertrot being there, it was a fireman, in
his nice blue uniform, with silver buttons on the coat, and
he was wiping his feet on the mat.</p>

<p>“Quick!” he cried, for firemen always have to be quick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
you know. “Quick! Let me in! The chimney is on fire,
and I must put it out!”</p>

<p>“Put out which, the fire or the chimney?” asked Tommy,
who was often a funny sort of a little fellow.</p>

<p>“Put the fire out, of course,” cried the fireman. “Ha!
I thought so!” he exclaimed, when he had rushed into the
front room and had seen the big blaze in the fireplace. “There
is too much wood on there. Quick, get me a lot of salt!”</p>

<p>So Mary ran to the kitchen to get the salt, for Suzette
had gone upstairs, to make the beds, I guess, and the nursemaid
didn’t even know the fireman was in the house. Back
Mary came running with a whole bowlful of salt.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, Mr. Fireman,” said Tommy, “before you put
out the fire, mayn’t we just run out on the sidewalk and see
it spouting up out of the chimney top? Mayn’t we, please?
We’ve never seen a chimney on fire.”</p>

<p>“Mamma said we weren’t to go out,” spoke Mary.</p>

<p>“But this is a most extra-extra-extraordinary occasion,”
said Tommy. “It isn’t exactly like the house falling down,
but if the fire in the chimney burns long enough it may fall
down, mightn’t it, Mr. Fireman?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he answered, and he got ready to throw salt
on the fire, for that puts out a blaze in the chimney, you know.
Yes, really it does. I’m not fooling a bit, honestly.</p>

<p>“Oh, may we go out?” asked Mary this time, and the fireman
said they might, and that he’d wait a minute before he
threw the salt on the flames. So out the Trippertrots ran, and
sure enough, there was a lot of fire coming out of the top of
their chimney. You see, the soot—that is, the black stuff inside—had
caught fire from the big blaze Suzette had made
on the hearth.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, as the children stood on the sidewalk,
the fire went out, for the fireman threw on the salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Now we must run in,” said Mary. “It’s chilly here, and
the fire’s out, anyhow, so there’s nothing more to see. Come
on, boys.”</p>

<p>In the children ran, and the fireman was getting ready
to go out, for he had finished his work. He said he happened
to be passing along the street, when he saw the chimney on
fire, and then he hurried in.</p>

<p>“But now the fire is out, and so I am going out, too,” said
the fireman; and out he went, as quickly as you can stub your
toe on a stone in the road.</p>

<p>“Now there isn’t any nice warm blaze on the hearth,”
said Mary, after a while. “What shall we play now? We
can’t look at pictures in the fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just thought of something!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“We forgot to thank that fireman,” went on Tommy, “and
that’s very impolite. He did us a great favor in putting out
the chimney fire, and now I’m going to run after him and
thank him.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, but mamma wouldn’t like us to go out; you know she
wouldn’t,” said Mary quickly.</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t like us not to thank the fireman, either,”
spoke Johnny. “I guess this is one of those most extra-extra-extraordinary
occasions she spoke of, like the house falling
down, so I’m going.”</p>

<p>Then he put on his hat and coat, and Tommy did the
same.</p>

<p>“Well, if you two are going, I’m not going to stay here
alone,” said Mary. “I’ll come also.”</p>

<p>Well, Suzette wasn’t there to stop them, and in another
minute away the Trippertrot children were tripping and trotting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
again. They just couldn’t seem to stay home, could
they?</p>

<p>They looked up the street, but they couldn’t see the kind
fireman. Then they looked down the street, but they couldn’t
see him there, either.</p>

<p>“I know what we’ll do,” said Tommy. “We’ll walk along
until we come to the fire-house where he lives, and then we’ll
thank him.”</p>

<p>So, hand in hand, they went down the street, looking for
the fire-house. Pretty soon they met a man.</p>

<p>“Can you please tell us where to find the fireman?” asked
Tommy politely.</p>

<p>“Why, is your house on fire?” asked the man quickly.</p>

<p>“No, but the chimney was, and the kind fireman put it
out, but we forgot to thank him, and now we’re looking for
him,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, the fire-house is just around the corner, and
down the street a little way,” said the man. “But don’t get
lost,” and he smiled at them.</p>

<p>“I guess he knows we’re the Trippertrots,” spoke Johnny.
“But we won’t get lost this time.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon they were at the fire-house where the firemen
live, and where they keep the fire-engine and the horses.
There were some firemen in front of the place, so Tommy
went up to them and said:</p>

<p>“If you please, we want to thank the kind fireman who
put out the blaze in our chimney, because we forgot it when
he was at our house. But I don’t see him here,” the little
Trippertrot boy went on, as he looked among all the firemen,
and couldn’t pick out the special one he wanted.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the captain of the firemen, “that was
George. He telephoned to me that he had put out a chimney
fire on his way home to dinner. You see, he hasn’t yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
come back,” the captain said to the children, “but if you would
like to stay here a while he will soon come, and you can thank
him.”</p>

<p>“Shall we stay?” asked Mary of her brothers.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Johnny and Tommy quickly, but they didn’t
look at Mary, for they were looking through the doorway at
the shining fire-engine and the big brass bell on the wall.</p>

<p>“But maybe we’ll get lost, and mamma wouldn’t like us
to stay here,” went on Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can’t get lost in a fire-house,” said Tommy, and
he wished the horses would run out, so he could see them.</p>

<p>“Besides, I guess the firemen know where our house is,”
said Johnny. “You do, don’t you?” he asked of the captain.
“It’s a house with a red chimney on it.”</p>

<p>“I guess I can find it,” answered the captain, with a laugh,
and all the men laughed, too. Then the children went inside
the fire-house, and all of a sudden a big bell began to ring.</p>

<p>Ding! Dong! Cling! Clang!</p>

<p>Those firemen rushed about like anything, and the captain
grabbed up the children and set them on a table, and the
horses ran out and hitched themselves to the shining engine.
Then men and horses ran out with the engine, and there the
Trippertrots were—left all alone in the fire-house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER TEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE FUNNY BOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Why</span>, where in the world do you s’pose all the horses
and the men went to?” asked Mary Trippertrot, as she looked
at her two brothers, who, like herself, were on top of the table
where the fireman captain had set them. “Where did they
go in such a hurry?”</p>

<p>“To a fire, of course,” answered Tommy. “Whenever the
bell rings there is a fire, and the horses and the men have to
take the engine to it.”</p>

<p>“Does the engine want to see the fire?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“No. It wants to squirt water on it and put it out,” replied
his brother.</p>

<p>“Do the firemen have to go to a fire even at night?” asked
Mary.</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Tommy.</p>

<p>“Then I should think they’d take out the bell after supper,
or fix it so it couldn’t ring, and make them go to fires,” went
on Mary. “I shouldn’t like to go out in the dark. Why,
some nights it rains or snows!”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! That doesn’t make any difference to a fireman,”
said Tommy. “Firemans is always brave; aren’t they,
Johnny?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Johnny. “And some one makes the
bell ring in the fire-house, so they will know where the fire
is, and go to put it out, same as the one put out the fire in
our chimney.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“That’s so,” spoke Mary. “I wonder when he is coming
back? He missed going to this fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be along pretty soon,” said Tommy. “We’ll
just wait here. The bell may ring some more, and besides,
I haven’t seen half the things. I guess we can get down off
the table now.”</p>

<p>“But do you think we ought to stay?” asked Mary, who
wasn’t exactly sure that they were doing right.</p>

<p>“Of course we must stay,” said Johnny. “Why, we haven’t
thanked the fireman yet for doing us that favor, and mamma
wouldn’t want us to come home until we had done it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” added Tommy. “Why, don’t you remember
once Mrs. Smith gave me a piece of cake, and I forgot
to thank her, and came home, and mamma sent me back to
tell Mrs. Smith I was much obliged? And I’m real glad I
went back, for she gave me a second piece of cake. Oh, yes,
we must always be polite in this world.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and now let’s look at all the shiny things,” suggested
Johnny.</p>

<p>So he and his brother and sister went all around inside
the fire-engine house. Pretty soon the fireman came in who
had put out the chimney fire in the Trippertrot home.</p>

<p>“Why, bless me!” he exclaimed in surprise. “Everybody
has gone to another fire, and I must go, too!” And he was
about to run out on the street again, to find where the fire was,
when Mary said:</p>

<p>“Oh, but if you please, couldn’t you first wait until we
thank you, and then can’t you take us home? For I’m afraid
we’ll get lost if we go by ourselves. We’re always getting
lost, you know. But we forgot to thank you, so we came
here to do it.”</p>

<p>“Bless me! That was kind of you,” said the fireman.
“But I really haven’t time to stay, for I must go and help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the captain and the men put out this other fire. I really
can’t stay.” And once more he was about to run off.</p>

<p>“Quick! Thank him, Johnny and Tommy!”</p>

<p>“We thank you!” said Tommy and Johnny together, making
two low bows.</p>

<p>“And so do I thank you for not letting our chimney burn
up,” said Mary, making her nicest bow.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re welcome, I’m sure,” replied the fireman.
“But really, now, I must hurry away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just know we’ll be lost!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Wait a minute!” exclaimed the fireman. “I
have an idea. Here!” he called to a funny-looking boy who
just then came into the fire-house. “Jiggily, will you please
take these children home, so they won’t get lost? I put out
a chimney fire in their house to-day, and they came here to
thank me. You take them home. You know where the Trippertrot
house is, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the funny boy. “I can take them home,
all right, and I’ll be glad to do it.”</p>

<p>“Then I can go to this other fire,” said the fireman, and
away he ran, like Tom-Tom the piper’s son, waving his hand
to the children as he hurried along the street.</p>

<p>“Come on, little ones!” called the funny boy. “I’ll see
you safely home.”</p>

<p>“Is your name Jiggily?” asked Mary, and she didn’t quite
know whether she liked the funny boy or not, for he was very
funny-looking.</p>

<p>He had on a funny suit, partly green and partly yellow,
and his nose was stubby and short and turned up at the end,
as if it was always trying to fly up to the stars; but the boy
looked kind, and he was always laughing or smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes, my name is Jiggily,” he said to Mary, as they all
walked out of the fire-engine house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Haven’t you any other name?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” answered the funny boy. “My other
name is Jig; so you see my whole name is Jiggily Jig.”</p>

<p>“How did you get that name?” inquired Johnny.</p>

<p>“Why, they call me that because I can dance a jig,” said
the funny boy. “Would you like to see me?”</p>

<p>“Indeed we would,” spoke all the Trippertrot children
together, and then and there that funny boy did a funny little
dance in front of the fire-engine house. And a little black
poodle dog that was running past in the street saw him, and
would you ever believe it, if I didn’t tell you? but that dog
tried to dance just as Jiggily Jig was doing.</p>

<p>But, bless you, all of a sudden the doggie slipped on a
piece of banana skin, and he almost fell down. He would
have, too, only Jiggily Jig caught him by the tail and stood
him on his feet again—on the dog’s feet, you understand,
not those of Jiggily Jig—which shows you that you must
never, never throw banana skins on the sidewalk, as they are
very slippery.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was a very nice dance,” said Mary, who went
to dancing school sometimes.</p>

<p>“Can you do anything else?” asked Tommy, and he wished
the funny boy would come and live with them.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can whistle on my fingers,” said Jiggily Jig. So
he put his fingers in between his lips, just as if he was going
to eat a piece of pie, only, of course, he didn’t really have
any pie, or cake, either, and then the funny boy whistled as
loudly as an automobile horn can toot.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Mary, and she had to put her hands over
her ears, because Jiggily Jig whistled so loudly.</p>

<p>“My, that was fine!” cried Johnny and Tommy, who
wished they could whistle that way.</p>

<p>“Can you do anything else?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Yes. I can stand on my head and wiggle my feet in
the air,” answered Jiggily Jig; and before anybody could
stop him, even if they had wanted to, which, of course, they
didn’t, that funny boy was standing on his head in front of
the engine-house, and he was waving his feet in the air, as
easily as a baby can wiggle its pink toes.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s great!” cried Tommy and Johnny together.</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m going to try it,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“No! You mustn’t!” exclaimed his sister. “You might
slip, and get dirty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you might slip and also get hurt,” said Jiggily
Jig. “The best place to try that trick, until you learn how,
is safely at home, in the middle of the bed. Then, if you
fall, you won’t get hurt.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it as soon as I get home,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Do you know any more tricks?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, my gracious goodness me sakes alive!” cried Mary,
shaking her finger at her brothers and the funny boy. “Please
don’t show them any more tricks, or we’ll never get home
to-day. Can’t you take us home now, Jiggily Jig?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered the funny boy. “I forgot where we
were going. Come along, little ones.”</p>

<p>So along the street they went, the Trippertrots and Jiggily
Jig. But they couldn’t go very fast, because every once in
a while Jiggily Jig would have to stop and dance, and, of
course, he couldn’t walk then. And sometimes he would
whistle on his fingers, and all the dogs in all the streets for
half a mile around would think he was whistling at them,
and they’d come running up, wagging their tails; and, of
course, when there were a whole lot of dogs around them the
children couldn’t walk at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69-70]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p069">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center"><i>Jiggily Jig Would Stand on His Head.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And then, again, Jiggily Jig would stand on his head,
and that would make a crowd of people come around; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>then, too, the Trippertrots couldn’t walk on through the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll never get home, at this rate!” said Mary, and
she felt a little bit like crying, for she thought her mamma
would be in the house by this time, and would worry because
her little children weren’t home.</p>

<p>“Yes, we will soon be there,” said Jiggily Jig, as he looked
around to see if he could locate the Trippertrot house. But
he couldn’t yet discover where it was.</p>

<p>“I think it must be around the next corner,” said the funny
boy at last. “Come on. We will soon be there.”</p>

<p>Well, they turned the corner, but still the Trippertrot
home wasn’t in sight, and even Tommy and Johnny were
beginning to be worried now, when, all of a sudden, they
saw coming toward them a man pushing a little wagon on
two wheels, and on the wagon were a lot of pies; and behind
the man was another queer-looking boy, almost like Jiggily
Jig.</p>

<p>“Oh! Who is that?” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Why, the man pushing the wagon is a pieman,” said
Jiggily Jig.</p>

<p>“And who is the boy?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Why, that is Simple Simon,” answered Jiggily Jig.
“You know he used to be in Mother Goose’s book. ‘Simple
Simon met a pieman going to the fair. Said Simple Simon
to the pieman, let me taste your ware.’ That’s who the
boy is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I am to meet them!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“And is the pieman going to a fair or circus?” asked
Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, he is just coming back, because the circus is over!”
exclaimed Simple Simon. “But he’s got lots of pies left.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Hey, Jiggily Jig!” called Simple Simon to the funny boy.
“Let’s see who can turn the most somersaults.”</p>

<p>And then those two funny boys began turning somersaults
down the street, going over and over, faster and faster, and
getting farther and farther away from the Trippertrots.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gone—Jiggily Jig is gone, and we’ll never get
home!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the kind pieman, “I think I can take
you home. Come with me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER ELEVEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE PIEMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Trippertrot children stood on the sidewalk, looking
after Jiggily Jig, the funny boy, and Simple Simon, turning
somersaults. Then the Trippertrot children looked at the
pieman.</p>

<p>“Whatever shall we do?” asked Mary. “Oh, I wish we
had never left the house when mamma told us not to! What
shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Go with the pieman, of course,” answered Johnny.</p>

<p>“Yes, and maybe he’ll give us each a pie, and mamma or
Suzette could pay him when he gets to our house. I’m very
hungry,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“And I guess I am also,” added Mary.</p>

<p>“Why, bless your hearts!” exclaimed the kind pieman.
“Hungry, eh? That will never do! I can’t bear to see hungry
children. Step right up to the pie wagon, and help yourselves.
I have apple pie, peach pie, lemon pie, cocoanut
pie, orange pie, cranberry pie, and even sawdust pie, but I
wouldn’t like to give you any of that last. Sawdust pie is
very hard to eat.”</p>

<p>“Who does eat sawdust pie?” asked Mary, wondering
what it looked like.</p>

<p>“Oh, sawdust pie is for sawdust dolls,” said the pieman.
“I make it especially for them. That’s really the only thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
they can eat. But what kind would you children like—lemon,
peach, custard——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just love custard pie!” interrupted Johnny, smacking
his lips.</p>

<p>“So do I!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“And mamma says it’s very good for us,” added Mary.</p>

<p>“Only—only,” spoke Tommy slowly, “we haven’t any
money to pay you with just now, Mr. Pieman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that doesn’t matter in the least,” spoke the kind pieman,
winking both his eyes, one after the other.</p>

<p>“But when Simple Simon wanted to taste of your pies you
made him show you first his penny,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“And he didn’t have any,” added Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, but <i>that</i> was Simple Simon,” said the pieman, with
a laugh. “He’s different, Simon is. Why, he’d eat every
pie on my wagon if I didn’t make him show me his penny
every now and then. And sometimes he loses it, and then
he can’t have any pie for a week. But I don’t want any
money from you Trippertrot children.”</p>

<p>“What kind of pie does Simple Simon like best?” asked
Tommy, as he went close up to the pie wagon, and saw that
there were several large custard pies on it.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll eat almost any kind,” replied the pieman, “but
most especially he likes a Christmas pie, the kind I always
make for little Jack Horner, who sits in a corner. Yes, Simon
is very fond of Christmas pies, with sugar plums in them.”</p>

<p>“Do you make pies for Jack Horner?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” answered the pieman, “else he wouldn’t
have any to stick his thumb in. But come, now, choose your
custard pie, and after you eat it we’ll travel on and see if you
can find your home.”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know where it is?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the pieman. “I thought you did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“Oh, there we go again!” cried Tommy. “We’re lost
once more! Jiggily Jig knew where our house was, but he’s
gone off!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s gone off, sure enough,” agreed the pieman, and
he looked down the street, but he couldn’t see either Jiggily
Jig or Simple Simon.</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps Jiggily Jig would have told you where
our house was before he began turning those somersaults,”
said Mary.</p>

<p>“Bless you, no, he didn’t,” answered the pieman. “But
you never can depend on Jiggily Jig. He’s too fond of doing
funny tricks. But don’t worry. I dare say I can manage to
find your house. So come along, eat your pie, and be happy.”</p>

<p>Then he cut a nice, fresh custard pie for them, and gave
them each a piece. Oh, it was most delicious! Which means
very nice, you know. Yes, that pie was certainly good, and
I wish I could give you all some, if you were allowed to eat
it, but I’m not—I mean I’m not allowed to give you any,
because there wouldn’t be enough to go around.</p>

<p>“Well, now, if you’re all ready, we’ll start off,” said the
kind pieman, when the Trippertrot children had finished eating.
“We will go up one street and down another, and perhaps
after a while we may come to your home.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we won’t,” answered Mary. “We always do
seem to have such bad luck in losing our home. I’m sure
we never mean to run off, but something always seems to
happen.”</p>

<p>“This time it was a fire,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“And the other time it was a little lost girl, crying in the
street,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind,” said the pieman. “I’ll sing a little
song as we go along, and people will come to the doors or
windows of their houses to see what I have to sell, and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
of the people may see you children, and know you. Then
they can tell me where to take you home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” cried Mary, dancing up and down, almost
like Jiggily Jig did.</p>

<p>“Lots and lots of people know us,” said Johnny. “I’m
sure that would be a very good plan.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll do it,” spoke the pieman. “Now let me see,
what song shall I sing? Oh, I know one.” And then he
sang this song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“I am a jolly pieman,</div>
<div class="indent">My pies are nice and sweet;</div>
<div class="verse">They’re made of many different things</div>
<div class="indent">For boys and girls to eat.</div>
<div class="verse">If you would kindly try them,</div>
<div class="indent">I think you’d like them, too,</div>
<div class="verse">Because there is a special pie</div>
<div class="indent">Made specially for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“There’s lemon, peach and apple,</div>
<div class="indent">And cocoanut and plum,</div>
<div class="verse">And custard pie and orange,</div>
<div class="indent">And also chewing-gum.</div>
<div class="verse">But, best of all, is Christmas,</div>
<div class="indent">A pie you all may eat,</div>
<div class="verse">The kind Jack Horner had when he</div>
<div class="indent">Sat in his corner seat.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Well, no sooner had the kind pieman finished his song
than all the people along the street began opening their doors
and windows, and putting their heads out.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” cried some boys and girls who were just home
from school. “We would like some pies.”</p>

<p>“Then come and get them,” said the pieman, and the boys
and girls, and lots of ladies, also, came around the pieman’s
wagon, and bought his pies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Then, when he was wrapping up the pies, or taking in
the money, or making change, the pieman would say:</p>

<p>“Do any of you boys or girls, or ladies know where these
children live?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t they know where they live themselves?” asked
one lady.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered the pieman. “These are the three
little Trippertrots, and they are always getting lost. I am
looking for their house as I go along selling pies.”</p>

<p>But no one seemed to know where Mary or Johnny or
Tommy lived. Lots and lots of boys and girls and ladies
and men came out to buy pies, and they looked at the children,
but none knew where they lived.</p>

<p>“Maybe some big giant has moved our house away,” said
Tommy, “and that’s why we can’t find it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course not!” exclaimed Mary. “Giants don’t live
around here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish they did,” said Johnny quickly.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, then we could ask one of them to take us up on his
shoulder, and he could walk about two of his steps and he
would be right at our house, and we’d be home,” went on
Johnny. “But I s’pose that can’t happen. We’ll have to trip
and trot along until the pieman finds our house.”</p>

<p>So along through the streets they went, the pieman singing
his little song, and selling pies, and asking all the people
he met if they knew where the Trippertrots lived.</p>

<p>But no one did, and Mary and Tommy and Johnny were
beginning to think they would never find their papa or
mamma, or Suzette, the nursemaid, again.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, as the pieman was pushing his
cart down a little street where there were lots of trees, and
many small houses with red chimneys on them sticking up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
through the roof—all of a sudden, I say—out ran a little girl,
holding a dollie in her arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Pieman!” cried the little girl. “I have been
waiting such a long time for you!”</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter?” asked the kind pieman.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sallie, my doll, is very ill,” said the little girl, “and
I want some sawdust pie for her.”</p>

<p>“I have just one left,” said the pieman. “Here it is, and
I hope she will soon be better.” Then he wrapped up the
sawdust pie for the little girl’s doll, and he asked her—asked
the little girl, I mean—if she knew where the Trippertrots
lived. “For I can’t seem to find their home,” said the kind
pieman, blinking both his eyes at once.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know, where they live,” said the little girl,
as she looked carefully at Mary, Johnny and Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Mary. “I’m so tired walking about,
looking for our home.”</p>

<p>“So am I!” exclaimed Johnny and Tommy.</p>

<p>“Then I know the very thing to do,” said the little girl,
as she looked in the paper to see if her sawdust pie was all
right. “Here comes the banana man, and he has quite a large
wagon which he pushes about on its two wheels. Let him
take you on his wagon, and ride you through the streets, and
perhaps you may find your home that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“It will be fun to ride in the banana wagon,” said Johnny,
jumping up and down.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think he can take us home,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>And just then along came the banana man, and he said
he would be very glad to help the Trippertrots get home.
So the pieman said good-by to them, and gave them each a
little custard pie, and then he went off to find Simple Simon
and Jiggly Jig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Jump on my wagon,” said the banana man, and the Trippertrot
children did so, as there was lots of room. Up they
hopped, and away they went along the street, looking for their
house, and wondering how long it would be before they
found the place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER TWELVE<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE BANANA MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It’s</span> almost as nice to ride on a banana wagon as it is on
a load of hay,” said Mary. “This is just lovely, I think.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Tommy. “And there really <i>is</i> hay on
this wagon, so it’s almost like a straw ride.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I always put the bananas on soft hay, so they
won’t break open when the wagon goes over rough stones,”
said the banana man. “But hold tight, now, as I am going
very fast.” And so he did, and the children were bounced
about, and up and down a bit, but then the hay was so soft
that they didn’t get hurt in the least.</p>

<p>“Do you know where our house is?” asked Johnny, after
a bit.</p>

<p>“No, but I think I can find it,” answered the banana man.
“I know where lots and lots of houses are, and I’m sure one
of them must be yours. I’ll go along through the street, and
you can look at all the houses you see, and pretty soon you’ll
see the right one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we have been away from home a long time,”
said Tommy. “Ever since early this morning, when we went
after the kind fireman to thank him. And we’ve been lost
from then on.”</p>

<p>“And maybe some one has painted our house a different
color,” spoke Johnny, “so we won’t know it even when we
see it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that,” spoke the banana man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
“They couldn’t have painted your house since morning, and
it isn’t night yet.”</p>

<p>“The false-face man could,” said Mary. “He is a very
fast painter, but then I know he would make funny faces on
our house, if he <i>did</i> paint it, so we would know it anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right,” said the banana man. “But lie down,
now, and rest yourselves, and I will wheel you up first one
street and then down the other, and soon you may be home.”</p>

<p>So he did that, and lots and lots of persons stopped to look
at the funny sight of three lost children sitting on the hay in
a two-wheeled banana wagon.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know where they live?” the banana
man would ask the different people who crowded around his
wagon.</p>

<p>“No,” said every one, and the men and women shook their
heads.</p>

<p>“Do you know any of these people?” the banana man then
asked of the Trippertrot children. But neither Mary nor
Johnny nor Tommy knew any of them.</p>

<p>“Then we will have to go along a little farther,” said the
banana man; and so he went up some streets that were hilly,
and down some that were smooth, and along some that were
very rough with cobblestones, and all the while he kept wheeling
the children in his wagon, or cart, if you’d rather call
it that.</p>

<p>And once the wagon went over a stick of wood, and
tipped to one side, and Mary nearly fell out. She would
have, only Tommy grabbed her just in time, and held her on
the hay.</p>

<p>And a little later there was a dog chasing a cat, and the
cat ran so fast to get away from the dog that the pussy jumped
right up in the wagon, into Mary’s lap.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor, dear little pussy!” cried Mary, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
rubbed the cat’s fur, and tried to make its tail smaller, for
it was all swelled up on account of the dog, you know.</p>

<p>“That cat looks like our cat, Ivy Vine,” said Tommy, when
the banana man had driven away the dog.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I just wish Ivy Vine was here now,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“And I wish Fido was here,” spoke Johnny. “He is kind
to cats.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we could only find Ivy and Fido, they would show
us the way home.” And Mary sighed a little, and a salty
tear fell out of her left eye.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the banana man. “I think we will
soon be there.” But he talked in a tired voice, for his legs
were very weary with tramping around all day, selling bananas,
and then giving the lost children a ride up and down
so many streets, looking for their home. Still he wouldn’t
give up.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they came to where a man was selling hot,
roasted chestnuts, and also some cold, boiled ones. And the
banana man knew the chestnut man, and bought some nuts
from him and gave them to the lost Trippertrots, for they
were hungry again, those three children were.</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t seem as if we were ever going to be at
home again!” said Mary, after a while, when she had eaten
some of the roasted chestnuts.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” spoke Johnny, as he ate some boiled ones.</p>

<p>“I’m never going to run away again,” said Tommy, “not
even if the chimney does get on fire.”</p>

<p>“Or even if the house falls down,” added Mary. And
then they put their arms around one another and sat there on
the banana wagon, and wished they were home.</p>

<p>And the banana man did the best he could. He looked
at all the houses, and he asked lots of people where the Trippertrots
lived, but none knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“I guess you will have to look for the kind policeman
again,” suggested Tommy. “He can find our house for us.”</p>

<p>“Or else Mr. Johnson, who took us home in his automobile,
the other time when we were lost,” added Johnny. “He
might help us.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better look for a policeman,” said the
banana man, for he was now very tired, because it was like
pushing three baby carriages, made into one, to push the Trippertrots
about on the banana wagon.</p>

<p>So he looked all over for a policeman, but he couldn’t
see any. I guess they were all down at the big fire, where
all the firemen had gone. And the banana man couldn’t even
see the pieman or Simple Simon, nor even Jiggily Jig.</p>

<p>“Oh! Whatever shall we do?” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Johnny. “Do you, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know, either,” replied Tommy Trippertrot.</p>

<p>But just then they turned around the corner of the street,
and they heard some music playing, and there was a hand-organ
man, with a monkey!</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” cried Mary. “There is the hand-organ man
who once rode with us in the automobile, and he will know
where we live.”</p>

<p>“No, I am sorry to say I don’t know where you live,”
answered the hand-organ man, when they had asked him.
“You see, I am a new man here, and not the one you thought
I was. I just bought this organ and the monkey from the
man who rode with you in the auto. The monkey may know
where you live, but I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s ask the monkey,” suggested Tommy.</p>

<p>So they asked the monkey. But, bless you! the monkey
couldn’t talk, you know, and all he did was to take off his
cap and make a low bow, as if he was asking for pennies.</p>

<p>“That’s of no use,” said Tommy hopelessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“No,” agreed Mary. “We’ll never get home that way.”</p>

<p>Well, the three little Trippertrots didn’t know what to do,
and they were almost ready to cry, when, all at once, Johnny
gave a loud shout.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Mary. “Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“No! But look!” cried Johnny. “There comes Ivy Vine,
our cat!”</p>

<p>“And there comes Fido, our dog!” exclaimed Tommy, and
he pointed to the dog and cat coming down the street together
like twins, only, of course, they weren’t twins—dogs and cats
can’t be twins, you know.</p>

<p>“Oh, now we will find our way home,” said Mary. “Ivy
and Fido will lead us. We can’t be far from our house.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” said the banana man, who was more
tired than ever.</p>

<p>“Here, Fido! Fido!” called Tommy.</p>

<p>“Come, Ivy! Ivy!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>The dog and the cat came running up to the children,
and they were very glad to see them. I mean the children
were glad to see Fido and Ivy Vine, and Ivy Vine and Fido
were glad to see the children. So they were all glad, even
the banana man.</p>

<p>“Now show us the way home, Fido!” called Tommy, and,
somehow or other, Fido understood, for he wagged his tail
so hard that it almost dropped off, and Ivy Vine wagged her
tail, and then they trotted on ahead of the banana wagon.
They looked back every now and then, to see if the wagon
was coming.</p>

<p>“Just follow them, and we’ll soon be at our home,” said
Mary. And the banana man did so, riding the children on
his cart, and a little later, just as they went around a corner,
there was the Trippertrots’ house!</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re home! We’re home!” cried Mary joyfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“And how glad we are!” cried Tommy and Johnny, and
they all hugged each other. Fido capered about, barking
as loudly as he could; and then out ran Suzette and Mr. Trippertrot
and Mrs. Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“Oh, you children!” cried their mamma. “Lost again, I
suppose!”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” answered Mary.</p>

<p>“And we were looking all over for you,” said their papa.</p>

<p>“But Fido and Ivy Vine and the banana man brought
us home,” explained Tommy, “and we had some wonderful
adventures since we went to thank the fireman.”</p>

<p>“Well, please don’t ever have any more,” said their
mamma.</p>

<p>“No’m, we won’t,” answered Mary.</p>

<p>Then they all went into the house and had supper, and
Mr. Trippertrot thanked the banana man very kindly, and
gave him some money.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any more adventures very soon,” said
Tommy.</p>

<p>But my goodness sakes alive and the mustard spoon! It
wasn’t any time at all before those three little Trippertrots
had something more happen to them.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER THIRTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE DANCING BEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three little Trippertrots were in the house one day,
looking out of the window. Suzette, the nursemaid, was in
the next room, trying to mend a hole that Mary had torn in
her red dress. I mean that Mary had torn a hole in her own
dress, not in Suzette’s, you understand, of course. And the
way it happened was this:</p>

<p>They were playing soldiers, the Trippertrot children were,
Tommy and Johnny and Mary, and Tommy had a make-believe
gun. It was really the poker from the stove, but it
looked something like a gun.</p>

<p>And they were having a great battle, making believe shoot
off the poker-gun bang-bang, you know, when, all of a sudden,
Mary ran past Tommy, and the poker caught in her dress,
and tore a hole in the cloth.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m afraid you can’t play soldiers any more,” said
Mrs. Trippertrot. “It’s too rough a game. Please play
something gentle, that doesn’t make so much noise.”</p>

<p>So Mary and Tommy and Johnny played a guessing game;
that is, they tried to guess how many people were in the trolley
cars that passed the window, or how many letters the
postman had in his bag, or how fast the butcher boy could
run when a pussy cat chased him, and all guessing games
like that. So that’s the reason, as I told you at first, why
the Trippertrots were looking out of the window of their
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Oh, I’m tired of this,” said Tommy at last.</p>

<p>“And so am I,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s make-believe we’re lost again,” suggested Mary.
“We can pretend that the parlor is away off downtown, and
that the dining-room is another city, and the kitchen can be
a cave where a fairy lives, and upstairs—I wonder what upstairs
can be?”</p>

<p>“That will be a mountain, of course,” said Tommy. “The
stairs are high, and so are mountains; and I’m going to climb
one, and get lost on the top, and build a campfire, and sleep
there all night.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! You sleep upstairs all night, anyhow,” said
Johnny. “Our beds are there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but this is only a make-believe mountain,” said Tommy.
“Come on! All ready to play this game! We’ll see
who will be the first one to get lost.”</p>

<p>Well, the Trippertrots played that game a long time, and
then Suzette had Mary’s dress mended, and the nursemaid
went to answer the back doorbell, for the butcher boy was
there with some meat for supper.</p>

<p>Now in about a minute you will see where the dancing
bears appear in this story. I’m almost up to that part, so
watch closely.</p>

<p>When Suzette was at the back door, Mrs. Trippertrot happened
to think there was no bread in the house for dinner.</p>

<p>“I know what I will do,” said the children’s mamma. “I
will just run next door to Mrs. Johnson’s, and borrow a loaf.
Now don’t you children go outside while I’m gone!” she
called to Tommy and Mary and Johnny.</p>

<p>“Not even in case of something most extra-extra-extraordinary
happening?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose if it’s something most extraordinary you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
may go out for a minute,” answered Mrs. Trippertrot, “but
don’t you dare to get lost.”</p>

<p>So they promised that they wouldn’t, and then they went
back to play the game of looking out of the windows, and
Mary said:</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish something most extra-extraordinary would
come along!”</p>

<p>“So do I!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>“And there it is!” suddenly cried Johnny. “If that isn’t
extraordinary, I’d like to know what is!”</p>

<p>And sure enough, down the street came a man with three
dancing bears. There was a little bear and a middle-sized
bear and a big bear, just as in the story book. And the man
had a horn, on which he played jolly, funny little tunes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope the bears dance where we can see them,”
said Mary, and Tommy and Johnny said the same thing; and
really it was just as if the dancing-bear man heard the Trippertrot
children, for, sure enough, he stopped in front of
their house, and began to blow a tune on his horn.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Hum tum-tum tiddle di de um,</div>
<div class="indent">Hum tum-tum tiddle day;</div>
<div class="verse">Dum-dum-dum fiddle faddle de um,</div>
<div class="indent">Ho tum-tum skiddle ray.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And with that, those bears stood up on their hind legs,
and began to dance around almost as well as you or I could
do it. I’m sure you would have been very glad to see them,
for they were such nice bears.</p>

<p>The big bear took big steps when he danced, and the
middle-sized bear took middle-sized steps, and, of course, the
little bear had to take little steps, for that was all the kind
of steps that were left, but they suited him exactly.</p>

<p>“Oh! Aren’t they fine!” cried Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Yes. I wish we had one,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t!” exclaimed his sister. “He might scratch
us, not meaning to, you know, but accidentally. I don’t want
a bear in the house.”</p>

<p>“I think it would be fun,” said Tommy. “We could play
we were hunters on a mountain, and make-believe shoot the
bear, only, of course, we wouldn’t <i>really</i> do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look! Look!” suddenly cried Mary. “One bear
is climbing a telegraph pole!” And, sure enough, the middle-sized
bear was doing that, while the man played more tunes
on his horn.</p>

<p>“Oh, look there!” cried Johnny. “The big bear is standing
on his head!” And, just as true as I’m telling you, he
was.</p>

<p>“See! See!” exclaimed Tommy. “The little bear is turning
somersaults just like Simple Simon and Jiggily Jig did!
Isn’t it great!”</p>

<p>Well, the man made the dancing bears do many more
tricks, and then he held out his hat for money, for that was
how he made his living. And Suzette gave the children some
money to give to the bearman.</p>

<p>Then the man made a bow, to show that he was thankful,
and the bears made bows, too, to show they were thankful,
for if the man hadn’t gotten any money the bears wouldn’t
have had much for supper. Then they started off up the
street to dance some more.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry they’re gone!” said Mary, and her brothers
were, also; and they were just wondering what else they
could do to have fun, when, all of a sudden, Tommy cried:</p>

<p>“Look! Look! The little bear has run away from the
man, and is coming back here!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I guess the man doesn’t know it, or he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
come back after him,” said Johnny. “I think we ought to
go out and catch the little bear for the man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you do it!” cried Mary, shivering.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s tame, and won’t hurt me,” said Tommy. “Besides,
we would be doing the man a kindness.”</p>

<p>“But mamma doesn’t want us to go out of the house,”
said Mary, for she could now see the bear quite plainly, as
he was right in front of the house again, and he was so kind
and gentle-looking, and he seemed to smile so at the children,
that they just loved him.</p>

<p>“I’m going out and catch him for the man, and give him
something to eat,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Who? The man or the bear?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“The little bear. See! He has a chain on his neck, and
we can lead him by that. Come on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Well, I s’pose I’ll have to go, too,” said
Mary. “This is one of those most extra-extraordinary occasions,
I guess. But I do hope we’re not lost again.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” called Johnny. “We can catch the bear,
take him to the man, and soon be in the house again.”</p>

<p>Well, would you ever believe it if I didn’t tell you?
That little bear just stood still when the Trippertrot children
came up to him, and he almost seemed to smile, you know
the way bears do, by opening his mouth, and then he made
a low bow.</p>

<p>“Oh, I almost believe he could talk, if he wanted to, he
is so cute,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Come along, little bear,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re going to take you back to the man,” said
Johnny. “He doesn’t know you’re lost, I guess.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p090a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p090a.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">DOWN THE STREET CAME A MAN WITH THREE BEARS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, the bear growled a little bit, but that was only his
way of saying “Thank you!” And then he stood still while
Johnny took hold of the chain around his neck—I mean the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>chain around the bear’s neck, not Johnny’s, for Johnny didn’t
have any chain on his neck. And Tommy also took hold of
the bear’s chain, and so did Mary, just the littlest, tiny tip
end, you know.</p>

<p>“Now we’re all ready,” said Johnny. “Come along, little
bear, and we’ll soon have you back to your master.”</p>

<p>So the three little Trippertrots marched down the street,
leading the tame little bear, and they expected any minute
to find the man with the horn. But they couldn’t see him
anywhere.</p>

<p>“Oh, we must find him soon,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Johnny. “We can’t take the bear back home
with us.”</p>

<p>“And if we let him go by himself he’ll get lost,” spoke
Tommy. “Let’s go on a little farther.”</p>

<p>So they went on a little farther with the animal, but they
couldn’t find the man who owned the bear, and they couldn’t
hear his tooting horn. And then, as they turned around a
corner, Mary suddenly said:</p>

<p>“There! I knew it!”</p>

<p>“Knew what?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“I knew we were lost again,” said Mary. “I’ve never
seen this street before. We are certainly lost again.”</p>

<p>“Oh! What will mamma say?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“And lost with a little dancing bear to take care of,” added
Mary.</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re lost, the bear is lost, too, and that’s all
there is about it,” spoke Johnny cheerfully. “Maybe we can
find our way back. Let’s try.”</p>

<p>So they walked down another street, looking for the way
back home, or for the man who owned the little bear.</p>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE PINK COW</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We don’t</span> seem to be getting anywhere very fast,” said
Tommy Trippertrot, after he and his sister and his brother
and the little tame dancing bear had walked up and down
several streets.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” agreed Mary.</p>

<p>“Are you sure we’re lost again?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“I certainly am,” replied his sister. “We must have come
farther than we thought we did. All the streets are strange,
and all the houses, too, and I don’t see a single person that
I know. Oh, dear! Isn’t it too bad?”</p>

<p>“Never mind!” exclaimed Johnny, putting his arms around
Mary to hug her. “I’ll take care of you.”</p>

<p>“And so will I,” added Tommy.</p>

<p>“Wuff! Wuff!” growled the bear in his gentle voice, and
that was his way of saying that he, too, would take care of
Mary. And he put one fuzzy paw around her neck, and
squeezed her the least bit; not enough to hurt her, you understand.
Oh, of course not.</p>

<p>“Well, what had we better do?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“We’ll ask the first person we meet if they know where
we live,” said Mary. “It’s funny, but we never can seem to
remember. I guess we ought to have a stamp and an address
on us, just as letters do, and then the postman could
always take us home.”</p>

<p>“I think that <i>would</i> be a good idea,” said Tommy. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
it’s too late to do that now, and I don’t see any people we
can ask,” and he looked up and down the street, but no one
was in sight.</p>

<p>“Oh, I tell you what let’s do!” exclaimed Johnny. “We’ll
let the bear go wherever he wants to, and maybe he’ll take us
home, the way Fido and Ivy once did.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Tommy. “We’ll do it.”</p>

<p>So they let go of the chain that was around the bear’s
neck, and Mary said to him:</p>

<p>“Now go ahead, little bear, and take us home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bears can’t understand our talk,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Why, Fido understands me!” said Mary. “When I
speak pleasantly to him he wags his tail, so I’m sure he understands;
and if <i>he</i> can, why can’t bears?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe he does,” admitted Johnny. “Let’s see
what he’ll do.”</p>

<p>The little bear didn’t do anything at first. He just stood
there on his hind legs, looking all around, and sort of sniffing
the air. I guess he was trying to see if he could smell his
supper cooking anywhere. Then, all at once, he started to
run across the street.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Johnny. “I guess that’s the way home!
We’ll follow the bear!”</p>

<p>So they ran after the shaggy little creature, who kept right
on going, looking over his shoulder every now and then, just
as if he was telling the children to follow him. And they
did. But where in the world do you suppose he led them?</p>

<p>You’d never guess, I’m afraid, so I’m going to tell you.
It was right up to a bakery shop window, that was filled with
all sorts of nice cakes and cookies and pies. Yes, just as true
as I’m telling you, that’s what the bear did. He came to a
stop right in front of the window, and then he looked up at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the children, and sort of whined, just as Fido, their dog, did
when he was hungry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what he wants!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked both her brothers at once.</p>

<p>“He wants some cakes,” said Mary. “He is hungry, poor
little fellow. That’s why he led us over to this bakery. I’m
going to see if the bakery man will give us some cakes or
buns for our little bear.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d give us some for ourselves,” spoke Johnny.
“I’m hungry myself.”</p>

<p>“So am I!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go in,” suggested Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, not all at once,” objected Johnny. “For if we did,
and left the bear all alone outside here, he might run away.
I’ll stay here with him, Tommy, and you and Mary can go
in and ask the bakery man for some cake.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tommy, and into the bakery shop he
and his sister went, leaving Johnny to take care of the baby
bear.</p>

<p>“Well, little ones, what can I do for you to-day?” asked
the baker-man of Mary and Tommy, as he came out of the
back room, wiping some flour off the end of his nose. “Will
you have bread or pie?”</p>

<p>“Neither, if you please, sir,” answered Mary, “but we
have a little bear, and——”</p>

<p>“Good gracious sakes alive and some ground cinnamon!”
cried the baker-man. “You don’t mean to tell me you have
a real live bear in here? Take him out at once, I beg of
you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he isn’t in here,” said Tommy. “He’s outside,
with my brother Johnny. But anyhow, he’s tame and gentle,
and he wouldn’t hurt a fly, not if one were to light on his nose
and tickle him. He’d just blow him off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95-96]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p095">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p095.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>Johnny Brought in the Bear.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Oh, he is a very kind bear,” went on Mary.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear that,” spoke the baker-man. “But
what do you want me to do—buy him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Tommy. “You see, he is lost, and we
are lost, and he came over here to look at your cakes because
he was hungry, and we are hungry, too. But you needn’t
mind us, unless you have some cakes you don’t want, and——”</p>

<p>But then Tommy had to stop to catch his breath, which
had nearly gotten away from him, and Mary said:</p>

<p>“Oh, you had better let me finish. What we want, Mr.
Baker-man, is some cake for our little bear. At least he isn’t
really ours, but he belongs to the man who plays tunes on the
funny little horn, and he is lost.”</p>

<p>“Who is lost, the man or the bear?” asked the baker, with
a jolly laugh.</p>

<p>“Both, I guess,” said Tommy, who had his breath by this
time. “But have you any cakes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, plenty of them,” said the kind baker. “I will
give you some, and the bear some, and——”</p>

<p>“But we have no money,” said Mary quickly, “and we are
lost—we’re always getting lost,” she said.</p>

<p>“No matter about the money,” went on the baker. “I
will give you as many cakes as the bear needs, and some for
yourself. Bring in the bear.”</p>

<p>So Johnny brought in the bear, and the baker cried out
as soon as he saw the shaggy little fellow:</p>

<p>“Why, I know that bear! He belongs to a nice Italian
in the next street. You had better leave him with me, and
I will see that he gets home safely. But first he must have
some cakes. Come here, Bruno!” called the baker to the
bear, and the little tame bear came right over to him, and
ate a chocolate cake out of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“You see, he knows me,” said the baker. “I will see
that he gets safely home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Mary. “I wish that some one
knew <i>us</i>, and would see that <i>we</i> got home. It’s dreadful to
be lost all the while, but we can’t seem to help it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the baker kindly. “Here, eat some
cakes, and then we will see what is to be done. Perhaps I
can think of a way to get you home.”</p>

<p>Well, you would never believe it if I didn’t tell you, I
suppose, but this is just how it happened. All of a sudden
into the baker shop walked a man, and he had a string in
his hand.</p>

<p>“What are you leading by that string? Another bear?”
asked the baker-man.</p>

<p>“No. I am leading my pink cow,” said the man.</p>

<p>“A pink cow!” exclaimed the baker. “I never heard of
a pink cow!”</p>

<p>“Well, I have one,” said the man. “You can look for
yourself, if you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p>So they all looked out on the sidewalk—that is, all but
the little bear, and he was too busy eating cakes to look—and
there, sure enough, was a nice pink cow, and the man
was leading her by a yellow string around her neck.</p>

<p>“How did she get pink?” asked the baker-man.</p>

<p>“She went to the circus once,” said the other man, “and
she drank a pailful of pink lemonade, in mistake for water,
so she has been pink ever since. But it doesn’t hurt her any,
and she gives as good milk as ever.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with her?” asked the baker-man.</p>

<p>“Why, I am going to sell her to a man named Mr. Jones,”
said the cowman. “He lives a few streets away, and he has
always wanted a pink cow. So I am taking mine to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“Oh! I wonder if that’s the Mr. Jones who lives two
doors from us?” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“What might your names be?” asked the pink-cow man
quickly.</p>

<p>“The Trippertrots!” cried Tommy and Johnny and Mary,
all at the same time.</p>

<p>“Then that’s the Mr. Jones, all right,” said the pink-cow
man. “He said he lived next door to a family of Trippertrot
children, who were always getting lost——”</p>

<p>“And we’re lost now!” interrupted Mary.</p>

<p>“But you can take us home!” cried Johnny.</p>

<p>“To be sure I can,” answered the man. “I’ll take you
home on my way to leave my pink cow at Mr. Jones’s house.
Come along, children.”</p>

<p>So they said good-by to the little bear, who was still eating
buns, and then to the baker, who gave the Trippertrots
some cakes to take home; and then the children started out
with the man and the pink cow to go home to their house.</p>

<p>“Oh, how thankful I am that we’re not lost any more!”
exclaimed Mary, as they walked along, with the pink cow
following behind, and switching her tail to keep the flies
away.</p>

<p>“Yes; and wasn’t it lucky that the baker-man knew what
to do with the bear?” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“You will soon be home now,” said the pink-cow man,
and they kept on up the street, and in a little while they were
safely at the Trippertrot house.</p>

<p>Just as the three children got in front of their house they
saw their papa and mamma, and Suzette, the nursemaid, looking
at them out of the parlor windows.</p>

<p>“Oh, there are our dear children!” cried Mrs. Trippertrot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“I wonder where they have been this time?” asked Mr.
Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“There is no telling,” replied his wife. “They do seem
to go to the strangest places. And look what they have with
them! A pink cow, of all things!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope they are not going to bring that pink cow
in here!” exclaimed Suzette, the nursemaid. “There is no
place to put it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I wonder what those children will do next?”
asked Mrs. Trippertrot. But there was no one there to answer
her, for Mr. Trippertrot ran out to get Mary and Tommy
and Johnny, and Suzette ran out to help him, and so Mrs.
Trippertrot thought she would run out herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma!” cried Mary. “We had the grandest
time!”</p>

<p>“And we took the little bear home,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“And the baker-man gave us some cakes, but we ate them
all up,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, you children!” cried their mamma.</p>

<p>“And what about the pink cow?” asked Mr. Trippertrot.
“I do hope you haven’t brought that home with you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the man who owned the cow. “I am taking
my cow to Mr. Jones, who lives two doors from you. He
wants her, and as I was coming this way, I brought your children
with me.”</p>

<p>“That was very kind of you,” said Mr. Trippertrot, “and
I hope they don’t trip and trot off again. Come in, now,
children, and tell your mother and me all about where you
were this time.”</p>

<p>“And we can tell you why the cow is pink,” said Tommy.
“She ate some pink ice cream once—strawberry, I guess it
was——”</p>

<p>“No, she drank pink lemonade,” corrected Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Oh, yes, that’s it,” agreed Tommy, “and so she’s been
pink ever since.”</p>

<p>So the three little Trippertrots went into their house, and
the man took the pink cow to where Mr. Jones lived, and
everybody was happy for a while, just as you all are, I
hope.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER FIFTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE TRAIN OF CARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> shortly after the Trippertrot children got home,
after finding the little lost bear, that, one afternoon, when
they were all looking out of the window of their house,
their mamma said:</p>

<p>“Now, children, I am going across the street to see a
lady, and I don’t want you to stir out of the playroom until
I come back.”</p>

<p>“May we go out when you do come back, mamma?”
asked Mary.</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” returned Mrs. Trippertrot. “At any rate,
you are to stay here until I come back.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we even go out if we see the little lost bear
again?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” answered his mamma. “Not on any
account.”</p>

<p>Well, the Trippertrots didn’t like to stay in very much,
but they were good little people, and they did just as they
were told, unless, of course, they happened to forget, or unless
a very extra-extraordinary thing happened.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish we had some game to play,” sighed Mary.</p>

<p>“I know!” exclaimed Johnny, “let’s play another choosing
game. I’ll let you have first choice, Mary, of whatever
comes along the street. Then Tommy can have his choice,
and then it will be my turn.”</p>

<p>“All right!” cried Tommy and Mary, so they began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
play. And when Mary saw an automobile coming alone
she chose that—not really to have for her very own, you
understand, but just to make-believe. Then it was Tommy’s
turn, and he picked out a nice horse and wagon. But
when it came Johnny’s turn, all there was left was a man
pushing a wheelbarrow, so Johnny took that.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s not a bit nice to choose,” said Mary, as she
wrinkled up her nose. “You may have part of my automobile,
if you like, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“And he can have part of my horse and wagon,” said
Tommy.</p>

<p>“All right, then I’ll take the horse, and we’ll all go
riding,” quickly cried Johnny. But, of course, this was
only make-believe, you know.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, Mary happened to look
down the street, and she cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, look! There is the pink cow running away from
the stable where Mr. Jones put her.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough, so she is!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>“We must go after her,” declared Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, mamma said we weren’t to leave the house,” said
Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, but she said we weren’t to go if a bear came
along,” insisted Johnny. “This is a cow, not a bear, and,
besides, she’s pink.”</p>

<p>“And besides,” added Tommy, “Mr. Jones wouldn’t
want to lose that cow, as it must have cost a whole lot of
money. I think we ought to chase after her and bring her
back.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” added Johnny, and then the two boys, catching
up their hats and coats, ran out of the house.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to stay here all alone,” said Mary.
“I guess mamma would want us to catch the pink cow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
as long as it isn’t a little tame bear. Wait, boys, I’m coming,”
she called.</p>

<p>And there those three little Trippertrots were running
away again, and without in the least meaning to. But it
just shows you what will happen sometimes; doesn’t it?</p>

<p>The pink cow was slowly walking down the street,
chewing her gum—I beg your pardon, I mean her cud—and
the Trippertrot children were chasing after her.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Tommy to the cow.</p>

<p>“Yes, wait a minute,” called Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk to her,” said Mary. “Cows can’t understand
our talk. Just catch hold of the string around her
neck, and then we can lead her back to Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any string on her neck,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Then, of course, you can’t do it,” spoke Mary. “Never
mind, I guess she will soon get tired, and then we can catch
her.”</p>

<p>But that pink cow didn’t seem to get tired, and all at
once she ran down a street where there weren’t any houses,
and she kept on until she was out in a big field, and the
children were chasing after her, but they couldn’t catch
her.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, there was a loud whistling
noise. At first the children thought it was a giant, but it
wasn’t, it was only the choo-choo engine in front of a train
of cars that just then came puffing along. And as soon as
the cow saw the engine, with the smoke shooting up out of
the black chimney, and when she heard the loud whistle,
that pink cow just kicked up her heels and jumped so
high that it looked if she jumped over the moon.</p>

<p>At least I think she jumped over the moon, for the children
couldn’t see her any more, though maybe the cow was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
only hiding behind the bushes until the train got past.
Anyhow, she wasn’t in sight.</p>

<p>“She’s gone!” exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>“There’s no use chasing after her any more, then,” said
Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, we had better hurry home, and tell Mr. Jones that
his cow has run away, so he can run after her,” spoke
Johnny.</p>

<p>Well, those Trippertrots started to go back home, but,
would you believe it, they couldn’t find the way. They
looked everywhere, but they couldn’t find the right path
that led back to their house.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re lost again!” exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess we are,” said Tommy, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“And what are we to do?” asked Johnny. “This is a
queer place to be lost in—out in the fields.”</p>

<p>Just then the train with the choo-choo engine on in front
came to a stop. A man with a blue coat, all covered
with shiny brass buttons, jumped off the first car.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” he called, waving his arms around his
head. “Everybody get on! All aboard, everybody! No
time to wait! Get on the train!”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Mary of her brothers in a whisper.</p>

<p>“He’s the conductor,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“And I guess he’s talking to us,” spoke Johnny. “He
wants us to get on.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mary. “I never thought of it. Papa
has sent the train to take us home. Get on board.”</p>

<p>“Ladies first,” said the conductor, politely, and he helped
Mary up the steps, and then he helped Johnny and Tommy,
for they were too little to get up by themselves.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” called the conductor again, and then the
engine gave a loud toot, and off the train started.</p>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS IN A TROLLEY CAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh, this</span> is fine!” cried Tommy, after they had ridden
some distance.</p>

<p>“It’s the best yet,” said Johnny. “I like this kind of
running away!”</p>

<p>“But we’re not running away,” said Mary. “We only
ran after the pink cow belonging to Mr. Jones, and now the
train is taking us home.”</p>

<p>“I hope we get in before mamma comes back from her
call across the street,” said Johnny. “She told us not to go
out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but she only said not to go out after a little tame
dancing bear, as we once did,” said Tommy. “This time we
went out after the pink cow.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it will be all right,” spoke Mary. “Oh!
look out of the windows, boys, and see all the pretty fields
and trees and—and——”</p>

<p>“And telegraph poles,” added Tommy. “My, what a
lot of them.”</p>

<p>“And look! There is the pink cow!” suddenly cried
Johnny, and, sure enough, the pink animal was running
along beside the train in a green field. But pretty soon the
train got going so fast that the cow was left behind.</p>

<p>“I hope she gets back home all right,” said Tommy;
and Mary and Johnny hoped the same thing.</p>

<p>Well, the train kept going faster and faster, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
children were looking out of the windows, having a good
time, when the conductor, with his blue coat all covered
with brass buttons, came in.</p>

<p>“Where do you children want to go?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Home,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Home,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Home,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Ha, so you <i>all</i> want to go home,” exclaimed the conductor,
with a jolly laugh. “Well, where might your home
be?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” asked Mary in surprise.</p>

<p>“No, I am sorry to say I don’t!” answered the conductor.</p>

<p>“He—doesn’t—know—where—we—live!” exclaimed
Tommy and Johnny together, slowly.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought papa sent this train to take us home,”
went on Mary.</p>

<p>“Well, it may take you to your home, if you tell me
where your home is,” went on the conductor. “Let me see
your tickets, and I can tell where you want to go.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t any tickets,” spoke Mary.</p>

<p>“No tickets!” cried the conductor. “Then why did you
take this train?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t take it,” replied Mary slowly. “It took us,
and it’s taking us now. But if it doesn’t take us home I
don’t want to stay on it.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” said Tommy and Johnny, as they started
to leave their seats.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment!” called the conductor. “Why did
you get into this railroad car?”</p>

<p>“Because you told us to,” answered Mary. “We were
chasing after the pink cow, that belongs to Mr. Jones, but
she got away from us, and then your train came along, and
you told us to get on board, and we did. It isn’t our fault.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Well, well! This is quite a puzzle,” said the conductor,
shaking his head, and scratching his nose with his
ticket puncher. “And so you haven’t any tickets at all,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Tommy, with his jolly little laugh, “I
think I have a ticket.” He looked in all his pockets, and
as he had a number of things in them, it took him some
time to find his ticket. There were balls of cord, an old
knife, some wheels from an alarm clock, and a piece of
chewing-gum. Then there was a red stone and a broken
lead-pencil, and when Tommy had all these articles out on
the seat the conductor said:</p>

<p>“Oh, I am afraid you have no ticket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have, just wait a minute, please,” said Tommy.
And then he pulled out a little tin can that he used to
take with him when he went fishing, and inside of that was
a piece of paper. “There is our ticket!” cried Tommy,
with another jolly laugh. “It’s a ticket I made for a magic-lantern
show that I had, and it cost two pins to come in to
it. Now we can go home, can’t we, Mr. Conductor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried the conductor, again
scratching his nose with his ticket puncher, “that isn’t the
kind of a ticket I meant at all. ‘A ticket to a magic-lantern
show! Admission two pins!’” he read from the piece of
paper as he looked at it.</p>

<p>“What kind of a ticket did you mean?” asked Mary,
politely.</p>

<p>“A railroad ticket,” answered the conductor. “That is
what I meant. This one is no good.”</p>

<p>“And can’t—can’t we ride on your train?” asked Mary,
and, somehow or other, a few tears came into her pretty
eyes. Tommy and Johnny felt like crying, also, but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
happened to remember that boys never cry—that is, hardly
ever—so they didn’t.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you can’t ride on that ticket,” said the conductor
slowly, as he gave it back to Tommy. “I shall have
to put you off——”</p>

<p>“Wait, I’ll pay their fare!” interrupted a nice fat man,
in the seat behind the children.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not going to put them off here,” said the conductor
kindly, and it is a good thing he wasn’t, for just
then the train was going through the woods. “But I’ll put
them off at the next station,” he said. “Then I will send
word back to the place where they got on, and some one
can come for them. It would not be right to take them as
far off as where this train is going.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” exclaimed Mary. “We want to go
home.”</p>

<p>“But some one will have to come for you when I put
you off at the station,” said the conductor.</p>

<p>“Oh, no one ever comes for us,” exclaimed Mary. “We
always have to go home by ourselves, don’t we, boys?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Tommy and Johnny together.
“We are the Trippertrots, and we are always getting lost,
but this time we didn’t mean to. It was the pink cow’s
fault.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I don’t know what in the world to do!” exclaimed
the conductor, and for the third time he scratched
his nose with his cap—I mean with his ticket puncher.</p>

<p>“Well, I know what to do,” said a voice on the other
side of the car. “I am going to give those children something
to eat. I know they must be hungry—children
always are.”</p>

<p>And, would you ever believe it? there was the nice little
old lady to whose house the Trippertrots once went when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
they were lost, and she had a cat, you remember, who
purred as it lay asleep in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, that lady knows us!” exclaimed Mary. “You can
tell where our home is, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t,” said the little old lady. “You
know you were at my house, but when I went to get a
policeman, to show you the way home, the queer little old
man came, and you went away with him, and so I never
found your home.</p>

<p>“But don’t worry now, I will give you something to eat,
and then I will get off at the next station with you, and I’ll
see if I can’t find some one to take you home.”</p>

<p>So the little old lady opened her satchel and she took
out some nice chicken sandwiches, and some jam tarts, and
some oranges, and gave them to the Trippertrot children
to eat.</p>

<p>Well, the train kept going on and on, and lots of the
passengers watched the Trippertrots eating the lunch
which the little old lady gave them, and the children themselves
were having a nice time, though of course they were
sorry that the pink cow had gotten lost.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the train conductor called
out:</p>

<p>“Here’s where you get off, children. Come along; step
lively, please.”</p>

<p>So they hurried out of the car, and the little old lady
went with them, and there the children saw a nice little
railroad station, like an umbrella, built under a tree. It
was right in the middle of a field.</p>

<p>“My, this is a queer place,” said the little old lady, as
she looked around. “I don’t see how we are going to get
away from here,” for, would you believe me? as soon as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
had gotten off the train, the cars and the choo-choo engine
puffed away and left them all standing there.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll find the pink cow, and she can take us
home,” said Mary, so she and her brothers looked all
around, but they couldn’t see the cow. But they heard a
funny buzzing, humming noise, and, all at once, along
came a trolley car.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the very thing!” cried the little old lady.
“I’m sure you can get home in that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can, if the conductor knows us,” said
Mary.</p>

<p>And when the trolley car buzzed up, with a lot of electric
sparks coming out of the roof, the conductor leaned
out over the platform and said:</p>

<p>“Who wants to go home?”</p>

<p>“We do!” cried Mary and Tommy and Johnny.</p>

<p>“Then hop on!” said the trolley-car conductor, with a
jolly laugh; so they hopped on, and the car went off before
the little old lady could get aboard.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Mary. “She’s left behind! Now we can
never find our way home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you can,” exclaimed the trolley-car conductor.
“I know you children. You are the Trippertrots, and my
car goes right past your house. I’ll see you there safely.”</p>

<p>So off the car started, with the three Trippertrots inside,
and the little old lady, who was left behind, waved
good-by to them. And the children didn’t have to pay any
car-fare, either.</p>

<p>Inside the car were many people. And there was one
very slim boy, who was very tall, and he kept going to sleep
all the while, until finally the conductor came in and hung
him up across one of the straps, just as if he was a clothes-pin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> 
And there the tall thin boy slept just as well as if he
had been home in bed.</p>

<p>And then, pretty soon, the car stopped right in front of
the Trippertrot home, and Tommy and Mary and Johnny
ran up the steps of their house, very glad indeed to get back,
I do assure you.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER SEVENTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE LAME BIRD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> and Tommy and Johnny Trippertrot were coming
home from school early one day when something strange
happened to them. You see, the Trippertrot children were
in the kindergarten class.</p>

<p>“What did you learn to-day?” asked Mary of Tommy,
as all three of them came along the street together.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Tommy, “I learned how to cut out a paper
lantern, and it’s real pretty when you hang it up.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice,” said Mary; “and will you show me how
to make one when we get home?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Tommy, who liked his sister
very much.</p>

<p>“And what did you learn to make in the kindergarten
class?” asked Mary of Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, the teacher showed us how to make a chain out of
paper,” answered Johnny, “and you can put it around your
neck for a necklace.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Mary. “I’d like a chain like
that.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll show you how to make one,” said Johnny
kindly. “But what did you learn to make to-day, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Oh, our teacher showed us how to fold a piece of
square red paper, and then cut it with the scissors, and then
bend the corners over and make a pin-wheel just like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
man sells at the circus, where there are lions, and tigers, and
elephants that eat peanuts.”</p>

<p>“Lions and tigers don’t eat peanuts,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“I know that,” answered Mary, “but elephants do, for
once I had a whole bagful, and I was giving the baby elephant
one peanut, and a big elephant behind me, when I
didn’t see him, reached over with his trunk, and took my
whole bag of peanuts out of my hand, and ate them up at
one mouthful.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that was terrible!” cried Johnny. “I wish we had
some peanuts now.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hurry home, and maybe mamma will give
us some,” said Mary. “Anyhow, we can make the paper
things which the kindergarten teacher showed us. Let’s
hurry home.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we can,” exclaimed Johnny, and then the
three little Trippertrots tripped and trotted toward their
home, for they didn’t want to get lost again, you see, and
have to be brought home in a trolley car.</p>

<p>As they were going down the street where their house
was, and when they were almost at home, all at once a little
birdie fluttered along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Mary. “There’s a little birdie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s lame, too,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can catch it, and make it better,” spoke
Johnnie, and he hurried after the birdie, which really was
lame. There was something the matter with one of its legs,
so that it couldn’t hop very well, and there was something
the matter with one of its wings, so that it could only flutter
along.</p>

<p>“Wait, little birdie!” exclaimed Tommy kindly, “I won’t
hurt you the least bit.”</p>

<p>But perhaps the bird didn’t understand Tommy’s talk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
At any rate, it still fluttered on, and the three Trippertrot
children kept after it, for Johnny and Mary wouldn’t let
Tommy go on alone.</p>

<p>“Wait, birdie!” called Tommy again, “and I’ll give you
my paper lantern,” for Tommy had brought one with him
from his kindergarten class.</p>

<p>But I guess the birdie didn’t like paper lanterns. Anyway,
he kept on fluttering along, just far enough ahead so
that the Trippertrot children couldn’t catch him. They
didn’t want to hurt him, you understand; no, indeed! They
only wanted to help him.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait a minute, little bird!” called Johnny, “and I
will give you my paper chain.”</p>

<p>But perhaps the birdie was afraid the paper chain
might get tangled in his legs. At any rate, he didn’t wait,
but kept on fluttering along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some cat might get him,” said Mary, after a
while. “We must try to catch that birdie, boys, and put
him in a safe place. Wait, and I will speak to him.”</p>

<p>So Mary walked on in front of Tommy and Johnny, and
said, in her soft little voice:</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, birdie, and you may have my paper
pin-wheel that I made in kindergarten class, and it goes
around and around as fast as anything.”</p>

<p>“What goes around,” asked Tommy, with a laugh, “the
pin-wheel or the kindergarten class?”</p>

<p>“Both of them,” answered Mary quickly. “The pin-wheel
goes around when you blow your breath on it, and
the kindergarten class goes around when teacher plays the
piano, and we march and play games. But now please keep
quiet, and I may get the birdie.”</p>

<p>So Mary walked on ahead, very, very softly, and once
more she told the lame birdie that it might have her pin-wheel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> 
I don’t know just how it was, but perhaps the
birdie thought if he had the pin-wheel he might be able to
fly up in the air again. At any rate, he stopped fluttering,
and a moment later Mary had him softly nestled in her
little, warm hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear, darling little birdie!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“One of his legs is hurt and so is one of his wings,” said
Mary, as she looked at the little lame birdie. “Oh, boys!”
she exclaimed, “I know what let’s do!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Let’s take this bird to a doctor’s office,” went on Mary,
“and the doctor will make him all better. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Tommy and Johnny together, and then
they looked up and down the street to see a house where a
doctor lived. And then, all of a sudden, Johnny cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary! Oh, Tommy! We’re lost again! We
came down the wrong street, when we followed the fluttering
birdie, and now can’t find our way home again! Oh,
what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind!” spoke Mary, after a bit, when she
had looked all around to see if she could find the way home,
but she couldn’t. “Never mind. We’ll go to the doctor’s
office first, and maybe he can tell us the way home.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he can!” said Tommy and Johnny, and then
they didn’t feel badly any more. Well, the Trippertrot
children walked on, Mary carrying the birdie, which was
just as happy as it could be now. And pretty soon the children
met a nice man.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” said Tommy, “can you tell us where
there’s a doctor’s office?”</p>

<p>“Why, are you sick?” asked the man quickly.</p>

<p>“No, but the bird is,” said Johnny. “And we’re lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117-118]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>The Trippertrot Children Ran On.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“But we didn’t mean to be,” said Tommy quickly. “You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>see, we were coming home from school, and we kept on going
after this birdie, until, all of a sudden, we were lost.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the man, with a jolly laugh. “Well, I hope
you will find your home again. The doctor’s office is just a
few houses down this street. Right next to the candy store,”
he added.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, then we can easily find it,” said Mary
quickly; “we just love candy.”</p>

<p>“Then here is a cent for each of you,” spoke the man,
and he gave them each a cent, and pretty soon the Trippertrot
children ran on, and they were at the candy store. And
they bought some sticks of peppermint candy, and then they
rang the bell at the doctor’s office.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, children?” asked the doctor, when he
came to the door. “I hope you are not all sick.”</p>

<p>“No, but the little lame birdie is,” said Tommy, “and
will you please cure him? We would give you some pennies
for doing it, but we just spent them all for candy, so we have
none.”</p>

<p>“Hum, then I’m afraid <i>you</i> may be sick, as well as the
birdie,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“We’re lost, anyhow, but we’re not sick—that is, not yet,
if you please,” said Mary. “But can you cure the birdie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m afraid not,” said the doctor kindly. “You see,
I am a boy-or-a-girl or a man-or-a-lady doctor, but not a
bird-doctor. You will have to take the birdie to a bird-doctor.”</p>

<p>“If you please, where is one?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the man-doctor.</p>

<p>“Then I guess you will have to be one yourself,” said
Mary. “If you can cure a boy or a girl you can cure a bird.
And then, please will you find our home for us? We’re the
Trippertrots, and we’re lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Oh, my! Oh, my!” exclaimed the doctor, and he laughed
and scratched his head. “I don’t know what in the world to
do. But come in, and bring the bird.”</p>

<p>Then he took them inside and he gave the bird some
warm milk, and he put some salve on the sore wing and leg,
and pretty soon the birdie was all well again.</p>

<p>“Now what are you going to do with the bird?” asked
the doctor when he had cured it. “Are you going to take
it home, and put it in a cage?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” exclaimed Mary. “Birdies don’t like to
be shut up in a cage. We’re going to let it go; aren’t we,
boys?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Tommy and Johnny. So the doctor
opened a window and out flew the little birdie, and it was
so happy that it wiggled its tail and called “cheep-cheep!”
to the children.</p>

<p>“And now can you please take us home?” said Mary to
the doctor. “We are tired and we haven’t been home from
school yet, and mamma may worry. Besides, we want to
make some paper lanterns, and paper chains, and paper pin-wheels.
Please take us home.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed the doctor. “I hardly know what
to do. Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” said Mary and Tommy and Johnny
at once.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is worse and worse!” exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know where we live?” asked Mary. “I
thought doctors knew everything.”</p>

<p>“I only wish I did,” said the doctor kindly. “But I will
see what I can do.” So he called in Bridget, his cook, and
asked her if she knew where the children lived.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Bridget. “They are the Trippertrots.
They live a couple of streets from here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Can you take them home?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“Ah, sure I can,” said Bridget.</p>

<p>“Then please do,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>So Bridget put on her bonnet and shawl, and started to
take the Trippertrots home, but on the way there something
else happened.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER EIGHTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE NICE BIG DOG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridget</span> led Tommy and Mary and Johnny Trippertrot
down the steps of the house and started off up the street with
them.</p>

<p>“Are you sure, if you please, that you know where we
live, Bridget?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“Ah, sure I do!” exclaimed Bridget, with a laugh. “I
know Suzette, your mamma’s nursemaid, and if I know
what house <i>she</i> lives in, sure I can take you to that <i>same</i>
house, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure you can!” exclaimed Mary, “and if we
had any of our candy left we’d give you some; wouldn’t we,
boys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” exclaimed Tommy and Johnny together,
like twins, you know.</p>

<p>“Oh, bless your dear little hearts!” exclaimed Bridget.
“I don’t want any candy. But come along now, and you’ll
soon be home.”</p>

<p>So she led them up one street, and down another, and
pretty soon they came to a window of a store that was filled
with pretty toys. Oh, there were trains of cars, and toy
soldiers, and dolls, and doll carriages, and steam engines,
and elephants that waggled their heads, and all things like
that.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you remember this place?” cried Mary to her
brothers.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p122a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p122a.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE TRAIN KEPT GOING ON AND ON</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“Yes,” said Johnny, “this is the toy shop where we came
the first time we were lost, and we choosed things from the
window.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” agreed Tommy.</p>

<p>“Have you children been lost before?” asked Bridget.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re always getting lost!” exclaimed Mary.
“Aren’t we, boys?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Tommy and Johnny together,
once more like twins, you know.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t our fault,” said Mary. “It’s just like to-day;
something always leads us off, like a lame birdie or a pink
cow, or the dancing bears.”</p>

<p>“Bless and save us!” cried Bridget. “What funny children
you are, to be sure! But come along, and we’ll soon
be home.”</p>

<p>Well, she was hurrying them along as fast as she could,
for it was getting on toward evening, you know, when all at
once Johnny fell down and he bumped his nose on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“There now, don’t cry!” said Mary.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to!” said Johnny bravely. “But—but I
want to very much, and it hurts awful, that’s what it does,”
and he couldn’t help two tears coming into his eyes, but he
didn’t let them fall down on the sidewalk; no, indeed. Oh,
I tell you he was a brave little boy!</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Bridget, “I’ll rub my gold ring on
the sore spot, and maybe that will make it better.”</p>

<p>So she rubbed her cold gold ring on Johnny’s sore nose,
and it was soon better—I mean his nose was better, not the
ring, you know.</p>

<p>Well, all of a sudden, as Bridget was leading the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
along the street, and they were thinking they would
soon be at home, Bridget cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I quite forgot that I left the meat cooking
on the stove for the doctor’s supper! It will be all burned
up! I must hurry back to the house. Oh, dear! Poor man,
he can’t eat burned meat! I must go back at once.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to take us back with you?” asked Mary,
and she didn’t feel like going, as her feet were very tired,
and she wanted to get home.</p>

<p>“Take you back with me?” cried Bridget. “No, I don’t
believe I’ll do that, or you’ll never get home. See, darlings,
it’s but a short step now to your house. Just down this street
a little way, and then you turn the corner, and there you are.
Don’t you think you can find it by yourselves? The little
boy who didn’t cry when he bumped his nose ought to be
able to find it.”</p>

<p>“I—I guess I can,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“We’ll try, anyhow,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“Well, if we get lost again we can’t help it,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t get lost,” declared Bridget, and then,
giving them each a kiss, she hurried back to the doctor’s
house so that the supper meat wouldn’t burn.</p>

<p>Well, the children stood still in the street for a minute,
and then they started in the direction Bridget had shown
them. They thought surely, this time, they could find their
house. They were beginning to be hungry.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s hurry,” said Mary, so she took hold of
Johnny’s hand on one side, and Tommy’s hand on the other,
and away they went.</p>

<p>They hadn’t gone very far before, all at once, and when
they hadn’t yet had time to turn the corner, a nice, big,
black and white dog came running toward them.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, there’s Fido, our dog!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“No, Fido isn’t as big as that,” said Johnny quickly.
“That is another dog.”</p>

<p>“But he’s as nice as our Fido,” said Mary, and the boys
were sure this was so.</p>

<p>“And oh, look!” exclaimed Tommy, when the big black
and white dog came closer to them, “this dog must have
run away, for there’s a broken string fast to his collar.
Maybe he broke it, and pulled away from the little house
in the yard where he lives.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he did,” agreed Mary. “Doggie, did you run
away, and are you lost?” she asked him.</p>

<p>The doggie wagged his tail up and down.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Tommy. “He’s saying ‘yes.’ He
must be lost, the same as we were.”</p>

<p>“Do you want us to take you home?” asked Johnny, and
once more the nice, big dog wagged his tail up and down,
just as if he was saying “yes,” that he did.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll take you home,” said Johnny kindly. “Wait
a minute, doggie, until I get hold of that string around your
neck.”</p>

<p>So the dog waited, and Johnny took hold of the cord,
and so did Tommy; and then Mary said:</p>

<p>“Oh, boys, I am <i>so</i> tired I don’t believe I can walk another
step to take that lost doggie home. Besides, you don’t
know where he lives, and it may take a long time.”</p>

<p>“Doggies always know their own selves where they live,”
said Tommy; “don’t you, doggie?”</p>

<p>And once more the doggie said “yes” with his tail, that
he waggled up and down.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Mary. “I’ll wait here until you
come back, after you take the doggie home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know something better than that!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“What?” asked Mary, looking about for a place where
she could sit down.</p>

<p>“Why, you can ride on the doggie’s back,” exclaimed
Tommy. “He is big and strong, and he won’t mind carrying
you the least bit; will you, doggie? You’ll carry Mary
on your back, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” barked the doggie, which means “yes,” of
course, and besides that he waggled his tail again.</p>

<p>So Mary’s two brothers lifted her up on the doggie’s
back, and he stood still, just like a pony-horse. Then Tommy
and Johnny took hold of the string on the dog’s collar
and they called:</p>

<p>“Go ahead now, doggie. Go where you live.”</p>

<p>Then the dog looked around, to make sure that Mary
was safely on his back, and off he trotted. He went so fast
that he nearly pulled Tommy and Johnny off their feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait! Please wait!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t go so fast!” begged Johnny.</p>

<p>“For you’re jouncing me all to pieces,” said Mary, who
was holding on as tightly as she could by winding her
fingers in the dog’s shaggy hair on his back.</p>

<p>Then the dog said: “Bow-wow! bow-wow!” which meant
that he was sorry, and he went slower.</p>

<p>Along the street went the three little Trippertrots, and
the nice big dog, and Tommy and Johnny and Mary were
watching all the while for the place where the dog lived.</p>

<p>But that dog kept straight on, and didn’t seem to want
to turn in anywhere.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Mary, “s’posin’ he hasn’t any home!”</p>

<p>“He’s <i>got</i> to have a home,” said Tommy. “All dogs
have homes, and we’ll come to this one’s pretty soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127-128]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>He Stood Still, Just Like a Pony-Horse.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“But we’re going right away from our home,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>Mary, “and maybe we can’t ever find it. I’m afraid we’ll
be lost again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” spoke Johnny. “Is your home near
here?” he asked, in the doggie’s ear.</p>

<p>“Bow-wow! Bow-wow!” barked the doggie.</p>

<p>“Now what do you s’pose he means?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” spoke Johnny, “but we’ll keep right on,
and we’ll get there some time.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon they met a nice man, and he said to the
children:</p>

<p>“Well, where is that big dog taking you?”</p>

<p>“If you please, he isn’t taking <i>us</i> anywhere,” said Mary.
“We’re taking <i>him</i> home. He’s lost.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said the man, with a laugh. “Well, be sure
you don’t get lost yourselves.”</p>

<p>Then Mary and Tommy and Johnny went on a little
farther with the dog, until all at once, when they got in
front of a nice, big, brown-stone house, they heard a little
boy cry out:</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, there’s Nero come back! Some children
are bringing him back! Oh, how glad I am! I thought he
was lost.”</p>

<p>“Is this your dog?” asked Tommy, when the little boy
and a man came down the steps.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the man, “that is my little boy’s dog.”</p>

<p>“And his name is Nero, and he was lost,” spoke the boy.</p>

<p>“Where did you find him?” asked the boy’s papa, while
Nero danced around and barked as loudly as he could, because
he was so happy to be home again.</p>

<p>“He was lost, and we found him,” answered Mary, who
had slid down off Nero’s back, “but now <i>we</i> are lost.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the man, “since you were so kind as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
to bring my little boy’s dog home, I will send <i>you</i> home in
my carriage. James,” he called to the coachman, “hitch up
the horses, and take these children home. And, Nero, you
must never run away again.”</p>

<p>So Nero barked, which, I suppose, was his way of saying
that he never would, and then he went in the house with
the little boy. And pretty soon the horses were hitched to
the carriage.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! We’re going to have a ride home!” exclaimed
Mary.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER NINETEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE POOR LITTLE BOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh, this</span> is the best fun yet!” exclaimed Tommy. “I’m
real glad we got lost this time.” He could see the nice coach
and horses now.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“And to think of going home in a real coach, with a real
coachman!” exclaimed Mary. “It will be real stylish!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they are real horses, too!” exclaimed Tommy,
as the coachman came along the driveway, driving the
prancing animals.</p>

<p>“Of course!” cried Johnny. “If they weren’t real horses
we’d never get home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Mary, “I guess Tommy meant they
might be rocking-horses, or sawhorses, or clothes-horses,
such as we once rode on. But I’m glad they are real horses.
Oh, here we are, all ready for a ride.”</p>

<p>And with that the coachman drove up to the steps and
stopped the carriage.</p>

<p>“Jump in, children!” he called to them, “and I’ll soon
have you home. Whoa, there, horsies! Don’t jump so and
prance about, or you might step on somebody’s toes.”</p>

<p>Then the horses stood very quiet, and Tommy and Mary
and Johnny got into the nice carriage. Oh, it was a fine
one! with such soft cushions on the seats, and little windows,
out of which the children could look, and see what was happening
in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>And oh, so many things were happening! There were
trolley cars rushing here and there, some one way and some
another way, and there were wagons being driven here, and
there, and some were from the grocery store, and some from
the butcher store. And then there were such lots of automobiles,
with their horns going “Toot! Toot!”</p>

<p>“I believe there must be forty-’leven autos at the very
least,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we’re not walking home,” said Mary, “because
an automobile might accidentally bump into us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s nice here,” said Tommy, and just then a man
with a peanut wagon ran it across the street, right under the
noses of the coachman’s horses.</p>

<p>“Hey, there! Where are you going?” cried the coachman
to the peanut man, and the coachman had to pull up the
horses very quickly, or the peanut man might have been run
over. Mind, I’m not saying for sure, but he <i>might</i> have
been, you know, though I hope none of us would want a
thing like that to happen. “Where are you going?” called
the coachman again.</p>

<p>“I am going across the street, so as to get on the other
side,” said the peanut man. “None of the people over there
would buy any of my hot peanuts, so I want to go over on
the other side.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said the coachman kindly. “I don’t blame
you a bit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it too bad that nobody would buy his peanuts,
poor man!” said Mary. “I would buy some, if I had the
money.”</p>

<p>“So would I!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>“And so would I,” added Johnny.</p>

<p>“Would you now, bless your hearts?” said the hot peanut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
man. “Then it is I who will be wishing you <i>did</i> have the
money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe if they haven’t I have,” said the coachman,
and, with that, what did he do? He put his one hand in
his pocket, while holding on to the horses’ reins with the
other, and out he pulled three five-cent pieces. “Here,” said
the coachman kindly, “give the children each a bag of hot
peanuts.”</p>

<p>“That I will!” exclaimed the peanut man, “and here’s a
bag for yourself, Mr. Coachman, for being so kind as not to
run over me while I was crossing the street.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pray don’t mention such a little thing as that,” said
the coachman, with a smile, as he took the fourth bag. Then
the peanut man hurried on across the street, and the coachman
drove the Trippertrot children on a little farther.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, after a while the coachman turned around,
and, looking into the back part of the big carriage, where the
children were, he asked them:</p>

<p>“And now, my little dears, where would you like me to
be driving? I mean where is your home? for I want to get
the horses back in the stable pretty soon. Where do you
live?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” asked Mary in wonder.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” answered the coachman, and he was so
surprised that he stopped eating peanuts.</p>

<p>“He—doesn’t—know—where—we—live!” cried Tommy
and Johnny together, and they, too, were so surprised that
they stopped eating peanuts. And then Mary stopped, too.</p>

<p>“How should I know where you live?” asked the coachman.
“The master just told me to take you home, and I
thought you knew where it was.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t,” said Mary gently. “You see, we are the
Trippertrots, and we are always tripping and trotting off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
somewhere, and getting lost. That’s what we did this time.
But I should have thought the man, whose boy owns the big
dog we found, would have told you where to take us.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t,” said the coachman. “But I’ll tell you
what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Tommy and Johnny and Mary, all
at once.</p>

<p>“I’ll drive all around, up one street and down the other,
and maybe you will see your house,” said the coachman.
“Please keep a sharp lookout.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just the way the banana man did, the time we
rode in the hay on his cart,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Yes, we got home then all right,” said Mary, “and I
think we will this time. Go on, Mr. Coachman, if you
please, and we will tell you when we come to our house, so
you can stop and let us out.”</p>

<p>“Bless their dear little innocent hearts!” exclaimed the
coachman—and he spoke to the horses to make them go
faster—“I never saw such children in all the days of my life.
Not to know where they live! Ah, well, sure the little
fairies will watch over ’em, and me, too, I hope, and I’ll get
them safely home if I can.”</p>

<p>So he drove on and on, through street after street, but he
couldn’t seem to find the Trippertrot house, and, though the
children looked out of the carriage windows, and ate their
peanuts, they couldn’t see their house, either.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, as Mary was looking at the
nice horses, and wondering if they would ever get home
again—all at once, I say—she saw a poor little ragged boy
standing on the street corner, and he was crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tommy and Johnny! Look there!” exclaimed
Mary. “That little boy is crying. Something must be the
matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“I guess there is,” said Johnny. “We ought to help
him.”</p>

<p>“We will!” exclaimed Tommy. “Oh, Mr. Coachman,
stop, if you please!” he called out of the front window of
the carriage.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter?” asked the coachman. “Have
you found your house?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered Mary, “but we have found a poor
little boy, and we want to see what is the matter with him.”</p>

<p>So the coachman stopped the horses, and out jumped
Tommy. He went right up to the poor little crying boy,
and asked:</p>

<p>“What is the matter? Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“No, I am lost,” said the poor little boy, and he cried
harder than ever.</p>

<p>“My! My!” exclaimed Tommy, in his jolly little voice.
“That is nothing. We are lost, too, and we don’t mind it a
bit. We are always getting lost. But the coachman is taking
us home, and I know he’ll take you home also. Get in
the carriage.”</p>

<p>So the poor little ragged boy started to get into the carriage.
The coachman saw him and cried out:</p>

<p>“I say now, where are you going?”</p>

<p>“He is coming with us,” answered Mary. “He is lost;
and will you please take him home, too?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried the coachman. “This is the worst I
ever heard! Here are you children who don’t know where
your own home is and you’re trying to find a home for another
lost boy. Oh, dear! This is terrible! Terrible!”</p>

<p>“But I <i>do</i> know where my home is,” said the poor little
boy, “only it got away from me somehow or other. I know
what street it’s on.”</p>

<p>“Do you, indeed?” cried the coachman. “Then that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
more than the Trippertrots know. Whisper now, and tell
me where is your home, and I’ll take you to it as fast as the
horses can trot. And then, maybe, we’ll have good luck, and
find out where these children live.”</p>

<p>So the little boy, who had stopped crying now, told the
name of his street and the number of his house. I forget
where it was, but that doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>“Oh, joy! Now I know where I’m going,” said the
coachman, and the horses started up. Inside the coach the
three Trippertrots were eating peanuts, and, of course, they
gave the little boy some, and he liked them very much.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the little boy cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s my house!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked the coachman. But the little boy
didn’t have to answer, for just then out ran a lady.</p>

<p>“Oh, Teddy!” she cried, when she saw the poor little
boy. “I thought I would never see you again! Where have
you been?” and she took him in her arms.</p>

<p>“I’ve been lost, mamma,” he said, “and these nice children
brought me home.”</p>

<p>“And where do you live?” asked the lady.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” said Mary sadly. “Everyone seems
to have a home but us.”</p>

<p>And now I’m coming to the strange part of this adventure.
Just as Mary said that, along the street came a man
with a long, white beard, and as soon as Johnny saw him he
cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, there is the nice old fisherman! You’ll take us
home, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, please do,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“We wish it so very much,” added Mary. “Won’t you,
please?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“To be sure I will,” said the old fisherman, and there he
stood, the same one who had fished up the rubber boots and
the raincoat and the umbrella, and who had taken the children
to the house of the false-face man. “I’ll take you
home,” he said. So he got into the carriage with the Trippertrots,
and away they went.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER TWENTY<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE LITTLE GIRL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> where have you been since I saw you last?” asked
the fisherman of Mary, as she and her brothers sat on the
coach cushions eating peanuts.</p>

<p>“Oh, we have been getting lost nearly every day,” she
replied. “Haven’t we, boys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered Tommy and Johnny together.
“This time it was a nice big dog that made us get lost,”
added Tommy.</p>

<p>“And on other times it was a pink cow, or the dancing
bears,” added Johnny.</p>

<p>“My! You children certainly have strange adventures,”
said the old fisherman, with a jolly laugh. “But I think they
will soon be over to-day, as we will be home in a little
while.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the coachman, as he turned around to
speak to the old fisherman, “do you know where these children
live? For they don’t themselves, and I never saw nor
heard of such a thing in all the born days of my life. Do
you know where they live?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the old fisherman.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness for that!” exclaimed the coachman.
“Get up, horses, we will soon have them home, and then we
can go home ourselves, and I’ll give you your suppers. Not
that I want to be impolite,” the coachman said quickly, “but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
you must see that it is a strange thing to be driving around
with children who don’t know where they live.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> queer,” admitted Mary, as she ate the last of her
peanuts.</p>

<p>“The next time we get lost,” said Tommy, “we’ll tie a
string to our house and take the cord with us, and when we
want to go back, all we’ll have to do will be to follow the
string.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said the old fisherman, and then he
told the coachman where to drive, so as to get to the Trippertrot
house as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“Have you caught any more queer fish?” asked Tommy,
as they drove along, for he could not help thinking of the
rubber boots, and the umbrella, that the fisherman had
pulled up on the hammock-hook out of the little lake.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t been fishing since then,” said the old
gentleman. “But I have my hammock-hook now, and, if
the driver will lend me one of the lines, I’ll fish right here,
out of the carriage window.”</p>

<p>“Why, you can’t catch anything by fishing out of a carriage
window,” said Mary politely.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” inquired the old fisherman, with
a smile. “Did you ever try it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mary, “I never have.”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t tell!” exclaimed the fisherman. “Why,
I have caught fish in the queerest places you ever heard of,
and then again, I’ve gone fishing in places where I was sure
there were fish, and I never got a bite—except a mosquito
bite. So you never can tell.</p>

<p>“Why, once I was in the market, getting something to
eat, and I happened to drop my umbrella, that had a crooked
handle. And when I picked it up, there was a fish fast to it.
What do you think of that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Oh, well, yes, of course!” exclaimed Johnny. “There
are fish in a market, for people want to buy them. I believe
<i>that</i> all right.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“But listen to this,” said the old fisherman. “Once I was
in a lady’s house, and I went in the parlor, and there was a
glass jar there on the table. I put my finger in the jar and
a fish bit me. What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but,” said Mary, “they were goldfish, in water,
in the jar. I have often seen goldfish in a parlor.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the old fisherman, “if there are goldfish
in a parlor and other fish in the meat market, how can you
tell but what there may be fish in this carriage? I’m going
to try, anyhow, for I haven’t fished in some time. Please,
Mr. Coachman, lend me a piece of the horse lines.”</p>

<p>So the coachman did this, and the old fisherman fastened
the line on his hammock-hook, and then he sat on the seat,
and let the hook dangle on the floor.</p>

<p>Every once in a while the old fisherman would pull up
the horse line, with the hammock-hook on it, and he would
look carefully at it. But each time there was nothing on,
and the fisherman was much disappointed.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you will never get any fish in here,” said
Mary, after a while.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” exclaimed Tommy. “For we have been
riding in here for some time, and if there were any fish we
would know it.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Johnny, “there isn’t any water here,
or else our feet would be wet, and fish can’t live without
water.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right!” exclaimed the old fisherman.
“I never thought of that. I have made a mistake. I should
have put my hook out of the back window of the carriage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
I’ll do it now,” and he did so at once, and then he sat very
quietly, waiting for a bite, while the coachman drove on to
the Trippertrot house.</p>

<p>All at once the old fisherman cried out:</p>

<p>“I have a bite! I have a bite!”</p>

<p>“Is it a mosquito bite?” asked Mary quickly. “Because
if it is you must put witch hazel on it.”</p>

<p>“No, it is a fish bite,” said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>“On your finger?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, on the hammock-hook,” said the old gentleman,
and then he pulled in the horse-fish-line, and there, on the
hammock-hook, was a tall silk hat, such as doctors sometimes
wear.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a funny catch!” exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it, though!” agreed the fisherman. “I don’t know
when I ever caught a silk hat before.”</p>

<p>He was just taking the hat off the hook, and looking at it
to see if there were any holes in it, when all at once the
coach stopped and the coachman said:</p>

<p>“If you please, sir, there is trouble out here.”</p>

<p>“What sort of trouble?” asked the old fisherman.</p>

<p>“Why, there is a gentleman here, sir, without any hat,
and he says, sir, that it’s in my coach.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder but what he was right,” spoke the
queer fisherman. “I think <i>I</i> have his hat.”</p>

<p>“Ha! What do you mean by taking off my hat?” asked
a voice, and there, at the coach window, stood a little man,
with a very red face. “Where is my hat?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” answered the fisherman. “I beg your pardon.
You see when I fish I never can tell what I am going
to catch. I hope I haven’t bothered you.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I don’t catch cold I won’t mind,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
little man with the red face. And he took the hat from the
fisherman, put it on his head, and hurried off.</p>

<p>Then the coachman drove his horses on some more, and
the queer old fisherman dangled his hammock-hook out of
the back carriage window again.</p>

<p>“I wonder what we shall catch this time?” he said to the
children, with a jolly laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe you’ll catch a chocolate cake,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Or an orange pudding,” added Mary.</p>

<p>“Or a dish of ice cream,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Well, it might happen,” spoke the fisherman. “Hello!
I have something, anyhow,” he cried, as he pulled in the
hook and line.</p>

<p>And what do you suppose was dangling on the end of it?</p>

<p>Why, a lady’s bonnet, of course! Yes, a real lady’s bonnet,
all covered with flowers, and lace, and ribbons, and
things like that. I mean the bonnet was covered with those
things—not the lady, you understand.</p>

<p>“Why—why!” exclaimed the fisherman, with a pleased
laugh. “I don’t know when I have caught a lady’s bonnet
before. I am having very good luck to-day.”</p>

<p>Then, just as he was taking the bonnet off the hook, the
coachman stopped the horses and said:</p>

<p>“If you please, sir, there is more trouble out here!”</p>

<p>“What sort of trouble?” asked the fisherman.</p>

<p>“Why, there is a lady here, sir, that says you have her
new bonnet.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” spoke the fisherman. “This must
be it. It got caught on my hook by mistake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope it’s not torn!” cried the lady, as she looked
in at the coach window.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” said the fisherman politely, as he gave
the bonnet to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>And on they went again.</p>

<p>“I must be careful what I catch next time,” said the
fisherman, as he once more put the hammock-hook out of the
back window of the coach. In a minute he pulled it in
again, and this time there was a loaf of bread on it, all
wrapped up in paper, and tied with a pink string. And no
sooner had the bread been pulled in, than there was a crying
sound out in the street, and a voice said:</p>

<p>“Oh, my bread! Some one has taken my loaf of bread,
and I haven’t any money to buy any more! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Bless me!” cried the old fisherman. “I wouldn’t have
taken any one’s loaf of bread for the world.”</p>

<p>Then he looked out of the coach window, and he saw a
poor little girl crying real, salty tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! don’t cry,” said the kind fisherman. “Are you
lost, too?”</p>

<p>“No, but I was coming home from the store, with a loaf
of bread,” said the poor little girl, “and all at once I—I
didn’t have it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, here it is,” said the old fisherman kindly, and he
handed it to her out of the coach window. Well, you just
should have seen how wide open the little girl’s eyes were.</p>

<p>“Are—are you one of the magicians that makes rabbits
come out of a hat?” the poor little girl asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I can do those tricks sometimes,” said the old
fisherman. “I just caught your bread by mistake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you do some tricks?” cried Mary and Johnny
and Tommy, all together.</p>

<p>“Not now, some other day,” said the old fisherman.
“Get up in the carriage, little girl, and we will take you
home.”</p>

<p>So the poor little girl got up in the carriage, and as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
knew where her home was, the coachman soon drove her
there, and the old fisherman gave her ten cents.</p>

<p>“And now for the Trippertrot house!” cried the old
fisherman, as they started off again. “We’ll soon be there.”</p>

<p>“And very glad I’ll be of it!” said the coachman, “for
such queer goings on I never saw before in all the born days
of my life. Fishing out of a coach! The idea!”</p>

<p>All of a sudden, as the children and the old fisherman
were riding along, a policeman, who was on a horse, galloped
up to the coach, and holding up his hand to stop it,
cried out:</p>

<p>“Is the old fisherman in there?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” replied the fisherman. “What is the
matter?”</p>

<p>“You are wanted at once,” spoke the policeman. “Down
at the bird and animal store. The big glass globe, where
the goldfish swim, was upset by a puppy dog wagging his
tail, and the fish are all flopping over the floor. The man
who owns them wants you to come and help him catch
them.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll go at once,” said the kind old fisherman.
“It will be fun for the children to watch me catch
the fish.”</p>

<p>“No, the Trippertrot children must stay here,” said the
policeman. “I forgot to tell you that a snake also got loose
when the fish fell out of the globe, and we wouldn’t want
the children to be bitten by the snake.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, we don’t want to be, either,” spoke Mary.
“But what is to become of us? Who will take care of us?
How will we ever get home?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will look after you,” said the policeman. “Here,
I will wrap you up in my nice coat,” he went on, taking off
the coat that he wore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“But where will we stay?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, we must stay somewhere, until the coach and the
old fisherman come back for us,” went on Johnny.</p>

<p>“Ha! I have it! The very thing!” cried the policeman,
as he saw a man going past carrying a big rocking-chair on
his head. “Let me take that chair for the Trippertrot children
to sit in until this coach comes back,” the policeman
said to the man, and the man did it at once.</p>

<p>So the policeman wrapped the three children in his
coat, and set them in the big rocking-chair, close to a street
lamp-post, so the coachman could easily find them again
when he came back.</p>

<p>“I’ll just write your names and addresses on a card, and
tie it to the chair,” said the policeman. “Then there will
be no trouble about you getting home again.” So he did
that, for he knew where the Trippertrots lived, though he
didn’t have time to take them home himself.</p>

<p>Then the policeman rode away on his horse, and the
fisherman drove off in the coach to catch the goldfish, and
the children were left sitting in the rocking-chair on the
street, beside the lamp-post.</p>

<p>And they didn’t mind it a bit, not even when it began
to rain all of a sudden, for they were very snug in the coat.</p>

<p>Well, it rained and it rained, and pretty soon the children
were so nice and cozy and warm that they went to
sleep. And then, who should come along but an expressman,
driving his wagon, and the wagon was painted red.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” called the expressman to his horse, as he saw
the rocking-chair by the lamp-post. “I must see what this
is. Maybe it dropped off some one’s wagon.”</p>

<p>So he went up to the rocking-chair, and my goodness
me sakes alive and a spoonful of mustard! Wasn’t he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
surprised when he opened the big coat, and saw Mary and
Tommy and Johnny sleeping inside it.</p>

<p>“Why, this is very strange!” said the expressman. “I
wonder who could have left three little children out in the
rain like this?” Then he looked at his wagon to see if he
would have room for them inside it. And he thought he
had.</p>

<p>“My! My! My sakes alive and some Thanksgiving
turkey!” cried the expressman. “I never heard of such a
thing in all my born days and nights! I am certainly surprised!”</p>

<p>“Heard of what? What is the matter?” cried Tommy,
who suddenly awakened, and looked up at the expressman.
“What is it that you are surprised at? Is it a surprise
party?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” replied the expressman. “But I am surprised
that any one would leave you here in the storm like
this.”</p>

<p>“The policeman did,” explained Mary, “but he wrapped
us up in his big coat. We were with the old fisherman, but
he had to go away to catch the goldfish that spilled all over
the floor. I guess he is coming back for us.”</p>

<p>“But if he doesn’t, what are we to do?” asked Johnny.
“I wish some one could take us home now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps this nice expressman can take us home,” suggested
Tommy, for he could see the expressman’s wagon
standing there.</p>

<p>“Of course, I could take you home, if I knew where
you lived,” said the expressman.</p>

<p>“It’s written on a tag tied to the chair,” said Mary, in
her most polite voice.</p>

<p>“What is?” asked the expressman. “What is written
there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“The address where we live,” went on the little Trippertrot
girl. “Do you think you can find our house?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can,” answered the expressman. “I’ll soon
have you home. You’ll be all right now, and I’ll pull the
canvas sides down on my wagon, and you’ll be as nice and
snug as you can be, even though it rains all the while, for
my express wagon has a top on it. And later on I’ll tell
the policeman and the fisherman that I took you away.
Then they won’t worry.”</p>

<p>So he picked up the chair and the children, both at the
same time, still wrapped in the coat as they were, and the
expressman put them, chair and all, into his big wagon.
Then, having looked at the address on the tag, which told
on which street the Trippertrot family lived, and the number
of the house, the expressman whistled a funny, jolly
little tune to his horse, and away he galloped through the
storm, up one street and down another.</p>

<p>And, oh! how nice, and warm, and cozy it was for the
Trippertrot children in the express wagon. The canvas
sides kept out the wind and the rain, and none of the drops
could get in the top, for there was a roof over the wagon.
It was so warm in there (for there was a nice lantern all
lighted and burning, as it was getting dark)—it was so
warm, I say—that the children didn’t need the coat around
them any more.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of the chair, and see the different things
that are in the wagon,” suggested Mary, after a while.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, let’s,” agreed Johnny. “We have never ridden
in an express wagon before. This is a new adventure.”</p>

<p>So they laid aside the coat, and crawled out of the big
rocking-chair. They saw lots of boxes and packages in the
wagon, and they wondered what they contained, but they
were too polite to ask. In fact, the expressman was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
busy to answer them, for the storm was quite bad now, and
he had all he could do to drive his horse through it. But
it was fun for the children in the wagon, as they were
warm, and they could see very well by the light of the
lantern.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, in one corner of the wagon they heard
a noise that sounded like:</p>

<p>“Cut! Cut! Cut-ka-dah-cut!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Johnny.</p>

<p>“That’s a chicken,” answered Tommy.</p>

<p>“What, in this wagon?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“It sounded so,” went on Tommy. “Let’s look around
and find it.”</p>

<p>So the children began looking in and around the different
boxes and packages, until, all of a sudden, Mary saw a
little box, with slats nailed across the front, like a small
chicken-coop, and inside was a dear, little red hen.</p>

<p>“Cut! Cut! Cut-ka-dah-cut!” called the red hen.</p>

<p>“Oh, you little dear!” exclaimed Mary. “I wish I had
you for my own.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it is coming to our house for a present to us,”
suggested Tommy.</p>

<p>“See if there’s a tag on it, like on our rocking-chair, to
tell where the expressman is to leave it,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, there isn’t any,” said Mary, after she had looked.</p>

<p>“Cut! Cut! Cut-ka-dah-cut!” cried the red hen again,
just as if she was trying to tell where she belonged.</p>

<p>“Has she laid any eggs?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any,” spoke Mary, as she looked inside the
little chicken-coop. “But maybe she will, if we wait a little
longer.”</p>

<p>So the three Trippertrot children sat down on the floor
of the express wagon, and watched the little red hen, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
she scratched around in the coop, but she didn’t seem to be
laying any eggs. And all this while the expressman was
driving through the rain toward the place where Tommy
and Mary and Johnny lived.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, there was a noise in another
corner of the wagon, and when the children looked
there they saw a dear, little white bunny-rabbit in a cage.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we could only have that!” exclaimed Tommy, in
delight.</p>

<p>“Has it got a tag on it, to say that it is coming to our
house?” asked Johnny eagerly.</p>

<p>“No,” replied his sister Mary. “It’s just like the coop
of the little red hen—no tag on it.”</p>

<p>And then there was a queer little chattering sort of a
noise in another corner of the express wagon, and when the
children ran over there, they saw a squirrel, with a big,
bushy tail, in a wire cage, and there was no tag on his
cage to tell where he belonged.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe the expressman will let us keep the three
pets!” cried Mary. “It would be lovely if he would.”</p>

<p>And just then the express wagon stopped.</p>

<p>“Here you are, children!” cried the man, in a jolly
voice.</p>

<p>“Where are we?” asked Tommy and Mary and Johnny
all together, like twins.</p>

<p>“Right in front of your own house!” said the expressman.
“I have brought you home, and the big coat, and
the rocking-chair, also. Here we go!”</p>

<p>And with that he picked up Tommy and Johnny and
Mary, and the chair, and the coat, and carried them into
the house. And maybe Mr. and Mrs. Trippertrot and Suzette,
the nursemaid, weren’t surprised to see their children
back after such a long time away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Oh, you runaway darlings!” cried their mamma. “Where
have you been?”</p>

<p>“Almost everywhere,” answered Mary. “But, mamma,
dear, one minute, please. I want to ask the expressman if
we can have the little red hen, and the rabbit, and the
squirrel we found in his wagon, because they have no tags
on the cages to show who owns them, and we might have
them.”</p>

<p>“Have them? Of course you may!” cried the expressman.
“I’ll bring them right in. You see, the tags were
torn off the boxes, and I don’t know what to do with
them, and I’ll be glad to have some nice children feed the
animals.”</p>

<p>So he brought into the Trippertrot house the squirrel
and the rabbit and the little red hen, and gave them to the
children, who had lots of fun with them for many days
after that.</p>

<p>And then Papa Trippertrot thanked the expressman,
and all of a sudden, who should come along but the old
fisherman. He got to the house just as the expressman was
driving away.</p>

<p>“Oh, such a time as I had catching those goldfish!” the
fisherman exclaimed. “They flopped all over the floor, and
the monkey in the bird store nearly caught one, and the
parrot almost had another. But, thank goodness, I got
them all safe in the fish-globe again, and then I went to
take care of you children, but I found you had gone away.
So I came on here.”</p>

<p>“How did you know we were here?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“I met Jiggily Jig, the funny boy, and he told me,”
said the fisherman. “He came along just as the expressman
was taking you home, and so I knew just what to do.
I sent the coachman and coach back, and I came here by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
walking. Oh, but such a time as I’ve had! And how glad
I am that you children are safe home!”</p>

<p>And Mary and Tommy and Johnny were also very
glad to get home, and their papa and mamma were very
glad to see them, and they invited the old fisherman to stay
to supper. And he said he would, and the Trippertrots
thought they would never trip or trot away from home
again.</p>

<p>But, of course, that isn’t saying that they did not go
away. In fact, they did, and they had many more wonderful
adventures, and I will tell you about them in the next
book of this series, which will be called, “Three Little Trippertrots
on Their Travels.”</p>

<p>So Mary and Tommy and Johnny, and their papa and
mamma, sat talking to the old fisherman, who told them
many strange stories of the funny things he had caught.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is nice to be home again,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” agreed Tommy and Johnny.</p>

<p>“And we are happy to have you home,” said their
mamma and papa. And now, for a little while, we will
say good-by to the Three Little Trippertrots.</p>
